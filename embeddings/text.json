Amikor pedig bekövetkezik valami siker vagy dícséret, akkor az égvilágon semmit nem érzek. A magánéletben is azt vettem észre, hogy nincsenek igazából céljaim, nem tudom megmondani mire vágyom, azon kívül, hogy sokszor azt érzem csak el szeretnék bújni az emberek elől, és eltűnni.\n\nSzóval ezzel kapcsolatban szeretnék segítséget kérni, mert úgy érzem az egy év alatt sem jutottam előre igazán, hiába próbálok folyamatosan, heti szinten \"valamit kezdeni\" az önbizalomhiánnyal.\n\nParák András: [https://pszichologuskereso.hu/pszichologus/parak-andras](https://pszichologuskereso.hu/pszichologus/parak-andras)\n\nNyúl Boglárka: [https://pszichologuskereso.hu/pszichologus/nyul-boglarka](https://pszichologuskereso.hu/pszichologus/nyul-boglarka)\n\nMay Nikolett: [https://pszichologuskereso.hu/pszichologus/may-nikolett](https://pszichologuskereso.hu/pszichologus/may-nikolett)\n\n---\n\nElső alkalom\n\nÖnutálat\n\nKimerültség, semmi nem tölt fel energiával, semmi nem okoz örömet\n\n---"},{"title":"Egy hét relax","path":"Archive/2021 Brain Dumps/Egy hét relax.md","text_content":"# Egy hét relax\n\nCreated: July 20, 2021 8:10 PM\n\nSemmit nem \"kell\", bármit csinálhatok\n\nKivéve zombulás\n\nDaily affirmations"},{"title":"Untitled 1","path":"Archive/2021 Brain Dumps/Untitled 1.md","text_content":"Life values\n\tAchievement: őszintén nem érztem még ilyet, soha nem éreztem egyiket se úgy hogy valid lenne\n\tAdventure\n\tBalance\n\tMindfulness\n\tGrowth\n\t\tAm I questioning my limiting beliefs and trying to overcome them?\n\tSelf-respect\n\tAm I fulfilling my potential?\n\tContribution\n\tCuriosity\n\n[https://highexistence.com/the-trap-of-trying-to-live-up-to-your-full-potential/](https://highexistence.com/the-trap-of-trying-to-live-up-to-your-full-potential/)\n\nDoing things that are enjoyable and/or useful\n\n\nMég mindig elég erős a szégyen érzése bennem\n\tPozícióm, munka\n\tTwitterre postolás\n\tHabitTracker\n\tEsküvő bármilyen aspektusa\nLehet hogy csak nagyon bezárkóztam az utóbbi években, és nem ér elég pozitív visszajelzés\n\nKarrier célok\n\tMit NEM akarok\n\t\tStartupban grindolni és kiégni\n\t\tFreelancer lenni\n\nHétfőn Ati\n\nKedden mosógép\n\nSzerdán terápia\n\nCsütörtökön IKEA, pszichiáter telefon\n\nPénteken buli\n\nTöbb social media, Twitterre írás kéne, megint befordultam\n\n[https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1429120212687736837](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1429120212687736837)\n\nAmit most érzek az ambíciótlansággal, meg hogy nem tudom mit csináljak, az valószínűleg rendben van, ennél senki nem érzi magabiztosabban magát, csak ennek ellenére megy előre, és meglátja mi lesz.\n\nElfogadás: ha most úgy érzem hogy nem kapom meg, akkor velem van a baj, magamon kell dolgoznom, nem több elfogadást keresni másoktól, úgyse kapok eleget soha\n\nYearnings\n\n- Feel productive, be busy, work hard\n    - Gyerekkor, jól kell tanulni, egyetem\n- Precizitás\n\nReverse yearning (fears)\n\n- Making mistakes\n- Not being good enough\n- What would others say about me\n\nHa ezeket le tudnám küzdeni, akkor sokkal érdekesebb életem lenne, és sikeresebben is csinálnék mindent\n\nDenial Prison\n\n- video editing\n- making music\n\n![[Archive/2021 Brain Dumps/Untitled/Untitled.png]]\n\nThis is promising news. There are likely dozens of awesome career paths that beautifully match your natural strengths, and it’s likely that most other people trying to succeed on those paths are playing with an outdated rulebook and strategy guide. If you simply understand what the game board really looks like and play by modern rules, you have a huge advantage.\n\n2) Specific game boards. For any careers that sound remotely interesting, ponder what the deal might be with that career’s current game board—the parties involved, the way success seems to be happening for others recently, the most up-to-date rules of the game, the latest new loopholes that are being exploited, etc.\n\nThe older I get, the clearer it becomes that our internal battle as the kindergarten teachers of our mind is like 97% of life’s struggle. The world is easy—you’re difficult. If you find yourself continually not executing your plans in life and your promises to yourself, you’ve uncovered your new #1 priority—becoming a better kindergarten teacher. Until you do, your life will be run by a bunch of primitive, short-sighted 5-year-olds, and your whole shit will suck. Trust me, I know.\n\nA better goal is contentment: the satisfying feeling that you’re currently taking the best crack you can at a good life path; that what you’re working on might prove to be a piece of an eventual puzzle you can feel really proud of. Chasing happiness is an amateur move. Feeling contentment in those times when your choices and your circumstances have combined to pull it off, and knowing you have all that you could ever ask for, is for the wise."},{"title":"Húsvét","path":"Archive/2021 Brain Dumps/Húsvét.md","text_content":"# Húsvét\n\nCreated: April 2, 2021 8:37 AM\n\nMásodik blogpost az IR remote-ról\n\n- [x]  17track contrib\n\nPostolni kéne már redditre smarthome blogpostokat\n\nHosszú hétvége jó lenne a HabitTrackerben elmélyülni, kitűzni egy célt\n\n- [x]  Erkélyt most már rendbe kéne hozni, IKEA rendelés\n\nSmarthome contrib, community ötlet: magyar API-k\n\nKicsit jobbá tenni a magyar közösséget\n\n[[Magyar API-k]]\n\nMiért nem tudok dolgozni a Habit Trackeren?\n\nMi kell hozzá:\n\n- idő (interruption free)\n- energia, fókusz (nap végén nincs már sok)\n- jól definiált feladatok, kontextus\n\nHétközben csak kisebb feladatok, jól definiált problémák\n\nHétvégén, vagy amikor több időm van, akkor mehet a tervezés, design, mélyebb problémák\n\nMiért halogatom az esküvő tervezést?\n\nNem vágyom rá, kényelmesebb a semmittevés\n\nNem ez tesz boldoggá → de biztosan találnék benne olyan szempontot, perspektívát, ami igen\n\nÖnbizalomhiány ellen: az élet rövid, YOLO, nem érdemes elvesztegetni\n\nHome Assistant macOS app profiling"},{"title":"Bias","path":"Archive/2021 Brain Dumps/Bias.md","text_content":"# Bias\n\nCreated: July 30, 2021 9:56 PM\n\nKéne egy lista a biasaimról, és amikor döntés elé kerülök, akkor a biasaim szerint korrigálni a döntést egyik vagy másik irányba\n\n- People pleaser vagyok\n- Túlságosan optimista vagyok, \"megoldjuk valahogy úgyis\", \"nem is annyira rossz\"\n- Risk aversion, hibázástól, kudarctól való félelem\n\nMi hiányzik, mire vágyom?\n\nElfogadás\n\nElbújás a problémák elől\n\nHa ezeket megélném néha tényleg, akkor nem vágynék állandóan rájuk\n\nSzombat\n\nOtter BBQ, Eszti szülinap étterem Tonett\n\nCsütörtök\n\nTemetés"},{"title":"Egybevont","path":"Archive/2021 Brain Dumps/Egybevont.md","text_content":"# Egybevont\n\nCreated: May 5, 2021 10:33 AM\n\nÁkos tapasztalatáról jut eszembe:\n\nRégebben sokat rágódott, mostanában már annyi meglepetés éri, annyi szar szakad a nyakába, hogy higgadt tud maradni most már, business as usual\n\nNVC: Káros kommunikációs minta: vallató\n\nCsak kérdez a másiktól, nem oszt meg infót a másikkal\n\nNem derül ki a kérdés szándéka\n\n---\n\nMay 18, 2021 \n\nTúl komolyan veszek mindent\n\nKapcsolódik Ákos tapasztalatához is\n\nA veszekedéseket is túl komolyan veszem\n\nGimiben is megkaptam hogy túl komolyan veszek mindent, nem lehet viccelni velem\n\nTúl komolyan veszem a pénzügyeket, a főzést\n\nA karrierem is, mégse csinálok semmit, mert le vagyok bénulva, nem elég tökéletes semmi"},{"title":"telegram","path":"Archive/2021 Brain Dumps/telegram.md","text_content":"# Telegram\n\nCreated: January 16, 2021 8:18 AM\n\nLiterálisan semmi örömöm napról napra, mindig csak arra gondolok, hogy mi volt rossz, mi lesz rossz, tönkre teszem az életed, miért nem vagyok boldog, miért nem vagy te boldog?

Research from Leonard Epstein’s group and others suggests that the answer is yes—by giving the rational brain a little boost using an exercise called [[Episodic future thinking]]. This phrase is a complex-sounding term for a technique that’s actually quite simple: Before making a decision, you imagine yourself in the future. When making a decision about something that pits your present self versus your future self, such as whether or not to eat a pastry, first imagine positive events in the future, such as your birthday or an upcoming vacation. Place yourself in the scene and imagine yourself enjoying it. The more vivid the imagery, the better. This process fires up the regions in your prefrontal cortex that process abstract concepts like the future and therefore causes your brain to intuitively weight the future more heavily in its decision-making process. This attenuates delay discounting. Epstein’s research shows that episodic future thinking reduces the intake of tempting, calorie-dense foods by nearly one-third in overweight women, and the same trick works for overweight children as well.\n\n### Physical activity\n\nSteps: 33K\n\nHeart Points: 354\n\n### Don’t End the week with nothing\n\nCache step dogfooding: Bitrise Frontend NPM cache gyorsítás\n\nHabitTracker Export feature merge\n\nCompose recomposition optimizations\n\n### Plan for the next week\n\nTisza tó\n\nOtter tali?\n\nSplatoon\n\nTash Sultana"},{"title":"2022 W3","path":"Areas/Weekly reflection/Archive/2022 W3.md","text_content":"# 2022 W3\n\nDay: January 22, 2022\nFood for thought: Yes\nProcessed: No\n\n- [x]  Brain dump\n- [x]  Unread stuff, inboxes\n    \n    Raindrop, browser tabs, emails\n    \n- [ ]  Flagged emails\n- [x]  Process inbox todo list\n- [x]  Review projects\n\n- [ ]  Fill decision log\n- [x]  Plan ahead\n- [x]  Schedule something together\n\n- [x]  Who to meet\n\n### Brain dump\n\nNagy anti halogatós nap\n\nÉvforduló\n\nCandy dolgokra válaszolni kéne, és fixálgatni\n\nEsztiék, Marciék meghívása\n\nFőzés\n\nBevásárlás\n\nDolgok elmondása, magam felvállalása\n\nValójában ott a gond szerintem, hogy nem bírom elviselni, hogy emberek véleményt formálnnak rólam, ítélkeznek\n\nUgyan ez volt otthon a zenehallgatás és a szobába benyitás\n\nÉs a közösségi média is\n\nBezzeg idegen szakemberekben azonnal megbízom, és mindenemet elmondom egy pszichológusnak\n\nCsak a rokonok, barátok, “hosszabb távú” embereknek megy nehezen\n\nEsztiékkel és Marciékkal a viszonyunk az nem az én hibám, és nem is feltétlenül az én feladatom lenne megoldani.

this\n- Or use the adjusted branch, but then every file is stored twice\n\n### Encryption\n- Shared encryption: the cypher is stored in the git repo (i.e. on GitHub)\n\t- This is better than the risk of losing the way to decrypt backups\n- With S3 bucket backup, probably `encryption=none` would have been a good option too, but can't change it later\n-

The main downside with this model is that it requires a bit more knowledge of your version control tool to execute. And, it requires corresponding tooling to play well with this change authorship model and to introduce as little friction as possible along the way since the number of interactions with tooling will increase as change size decreases, velocity increases, and there are more distinct units of change being considered for integration.  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm5sx2tf2jnf41n6848ps1tb))\n\n---\nTherefore, **I don't think the more, smaller changes workflow can be easily practiced with multiple pull requests using the common GitHub model without effectively moving the definition of a pull request away from equivalence with a Git branch**  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm85scfd6yxb8e8djqz7k20t))\n\n---\nSince larger changes result in a higher defect rate and slower review, GitHub's default of showing the *merge diff* effectively means GitHub is defaulting to lower quality, longer-lasting reviews.  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm85rzvz70c67bf55ptfypx0))\n\n---\nApplied to version control and code review, this means integrating a commit as soon as author, reviewer, and our machine overlords reporting status checks all agree it is ready, without having to wait for a larger unit of work, like the pull request. Succinctly, move forward as soon as you are able to!  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm85r08xa52f5c2c9wqjmwns))\n\n---\nIn summary, some high-level problems with pull requests are as follows:\n• Review of *merge diff* by default encourages larger units of review, which undermines quality and velocity outcomes.\n• Inability to incrementally integrate commits within a pull request, which slows down velocity, time to meaningful feedback, and can lower morale.\n• Tight coupling of pull requests with Git branches adds rigidity to workflows and shoehorns into less flexible and less desired workflows.\n• Deficiencies in the Git user experience - particular around what happens when rewrites (including rebase) occur - significantly curtail what workflows can be safely practiced with pull requests.\n• Tight coupling of pull requests with Git branches can lead to performance issues at scale.  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm864qbq2vvhmnvejg429n69))\n\n---\nWhen you use the version control tool wire protocol as part of *integration requests*, you have introduced the problem of scaling your version control server  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm87bgq5hf36ahws24rz51xk))\n\n---\nThe wire protocols for both Git and Mercurial were designed in a now-ancient era of computing and weren't designed by network protocol experts. They are fundamentally difficult to scale at just the wire protocol level.

It is based on a very simple idea, which is that when problems are really difficult and complex – problems like addressing hunger, containing terrorism, or helping an economy grow more quickly – the solutions come from the insights and capabilities of people working together.

It has been a marvelous fifty years. But I want to alert you to two very important facts:\n1. We are still not able to address critically important problems - particularly if those problems demand high performance ability to collect and share knowledge across groups of people.\n3. This inability is not an accident, but emerges from values and approaches that are \"designed into\" our approach to addressing innovation in computing.

What was particularly important about this investment was that, when it came to ISO 9000 compliance and other quality programs and measures, companies – even competing companies – joined together in industry consortia to develop benchmarks and standards. They even shared knowledge about quality programs. What emerged from this collaborative activity at the C level was significant gain for individual companies at the B and A levels. When you are operating at the C level, collaboration can produce much larger returns than competition.

This means having different groups exploring different paths to the same goal. As they explore, they constantly exchange information about what they are learning. The goal is to maximize overall progress by exchanging important information as the different groups proceed. What this means, in practice, is that the dialog between the people working toward pursuit of the goal is often just as important as the end result of the research. Often, it is what the team learns in the course of the exploration that ultimately opens up breakthrough results.

You have researchers, brilliant in their domain, who think of making as something essentially trivial, “just a matter of implementation”. And you have makers who don’t understand research at all, who see it as merely a rather slow and dysfunctional (and unprofitable) making process. This is certainly true in Silicon Valley, where it’s common to meet accomplished technical makers who, after reading a few stories from Richard Hamming and Richard Feynman, think they understand research well enough that they can “create the new Bell Labs”. Usually they’re victims of Dunning-Krugeritis, so ignorant they’re not even aware of their ignorance.

Douglas Engelbart [disparaged](http://dougengelbart.org/content/view/348/000/) the “dangerous, disappointing, narrow, path that we seem to be stuck with following”. When asked in 2006 how much of his vision had been achieved, Engelbart replied facetiously [“about 2.8 percent”](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/douglas-engelbart-invented-future-180967498/). Alan Kay gives talks asserting [“The real computer revolution hasn’t happened yet”](https://web.archive.org/web/20221022122155/http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2007007a_revolution.pdf) and in [an interview](https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now) has described the modern web as “reinventing the flat tire… at least give us what Engelbart did, for Christ’s sake.”  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp618488kgzy2j915fbaf4q6)) ^rw451204582\n\n---\nOur experience is that many of today’s technology leaders genuinely venerate Engelbart, Kay, and their colleagues. Many even feel that computers have huge potential as tools for improving human thinking. But they don’t see how to build good businesses around developing new tools for thought. And without such business opportunities, work languishes.  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp618py4rcs5ssqszv78nes8)) ^rw451204592\n\n---\nUnfortunately for Adobe, such mediums are extremely expensive to develop, and it’s difficult to prevent other companies from cheaply copying the ideas or developing near-equivalents. Consider, for example, the way the program *Sketch* has eaten into Adobe’s market share, after duplicating many of the best features from several of Adobe’s products, perhaps most notably *Illustrator*. And consider the way *Figma* is now eating into both *Sketch* and *Illustrator*’s market share. Both *Sketch* and *Figma* have done this without needing to make an enormous investment in research. That’s a big advantage they have over Adobe.\nAs Marc Andreessen has observed In Elad Gil’s “High Growth Handbook” (2018).:\n> true defensibility purely at the product level is really rare in [Silicon] Valley, because there are a lot of really good engineers… And then there’s the issue of leap-frogging. The next team has the opportunity to learn from what you did and then build something better.  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp61bns0nn6fv4k5qsam9pv6)) ^rw451204728\n\n---\nPut another way, many tools for thought are public goods. They often cost a lot to develop initially, but it’s easy for others to duplicate and improve on them, free riding on the initial investment. While such duplication and improvement is good for our society as a whole, it’s bad for the companies that make that initial investment. And so such tools for thought suffer the fate of many public goods: our society collectively underinvests in them, relative to the benefits they provide  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp61ffbm2rjk5p70f827e09d)) ^rw451205433\n\n---\ncompanies don’t use the necessary processes because there’s little value to them in doing so. By contrast, in “harder-tech” industries – say, chip design – companies have much more incentive to do deep research work. In those industries it’s considerably harder for other companies to duplicate or capture the value of that research.  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp61p31g27mk6q1pep7qkk08)) ^rw451206475\n\n---\nBut there’s a big difference between video game companies and companies such as Adobe. Many video games make most of their money from the first few months of sales. While other companies can (and do) come in and copy or riff on any new ideas, it often does little to affect revenue from the original game, which has already made most of its money  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp621ge88v0cvbc6ksttkgrs)) ^rw451207518\n\n---\nWhile these suggestions all avoid the public goods problem, they don’t directly solve the public goods problem. And many promising directions – including ideas such as the mnemonic medium and mnemonic videos – involve a substantial public goods element. Is it possible to solve the public goods problem in such cases? The two most promising approaches seem to us to be:\n• Philanthropic funding for research. This approach was used, for instance, by the field of computer animation and animated movies. Decades of public research work on computer animation resulted in a large number of powerful and (in many cases) publicly available ideas. This, in turn, helped prepare the way for companies such as Pixar and Dreamworks, which developed many of the ideas further, and took them to scale.\n• The model used by Adobe and similar companies, in which new tools for thought are a central part of the company’s operations, but not the core of their competitive moat. That moat may instead be built around training, marketing, documentation, and so on.  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp62rrbvtwscadzeh6e9sc31)) ^rw451210179\n\n---\nThe work is really about exploration of an open-ended question: how can we develop tools that change and expand the range of thoughts human beings can think?\nCulturally, tech is dominated by an engineering, goal-driven mindset. It’s much easier to set KPIs, evaluate OKRs, and manage deliverables, when you have a very specific end-goal in mind. And so it’s perhaps not surprising that tech culture is much more sympathetic to AGI and BCI as overall programs of work.  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp6be5a5mby5jemywx1fzcqt)) ^rw451315931\n\n---\nSimilarly, the invention of other tools for thought – writing, the printing press, and so on – are among our greatest ever breakthroughs. And, as far as we know, all emerged primarily out of open-ended exploration, not in a primarily goal-driven way.  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp6bgk3yga0wexk2wk5x3zj0)) ^rw451316961\n\n---\nIt seems plausible to us that work on tools for thought will be, over the next few decades, more important than work on AGI and BCI. And, given how fashionable and well-funded work on AGI and BCI currently is, it seems nearly certain that work on tools for thought offers vastly greater benefit, at the margin.  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp6btcvt6mx1jpma6g765kzt)) ^rw451325794\n\n---\nThere’s a general principle here: *good tools for thought arise mostly as a byproduct of doing original work on serious problems*. They tend either be created by the people doing that work, or by people working very closely to them, people who are genuinely bought in A related argument has been made in Eric von Hippel’s book “Democratizing Innovation” (2005), which identifies many instances where what appears to be commercial product development is based in large or considerable part on innovations from users.. Furthermore, the problems themselves are typically of intense personal interest to the problem-solvers.  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp6d38ca5k94v7zxfvac8713)) ^rw451340986\n\n---\n**Tools for thought must be developed in tandem with deep, original creative work:** Much work on tools for thought focuses on toy problems and toy environments. This is useful when prototyping, but to be successful such tools must ultimately be used to do serious, original creative work. That’s a baseline litmus test for whether the tools are genuinely working, or merely telling a good story.

For many professional and creative users, as introduced in [the introduction](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/), we believe that the trade-off of more responsibility in exchange for more ownership is desirable. Consider a significant personal creation, such as a PhD thesis or the raw footage of a film.

They are perhaps the closest thing we have to a true local-first software package: compared to server-centric version control systems such as [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org), Git works fully offline, it is fast, it gives full control to users, and it is suitable for long-term preservation of data. This is the case because a Git repository on your local filesystem is a primary copy of the data, and is not subordinate to any server.

As with a Git repository, what a particular user sees in the “master” branch is a function of the last time they communicated with other users. Newly arriving changes might unexpectedly modify parts of the document you are working on, but manually merging every change from every user is tedious. Decentralized documents enable users to be in control over their own data, but further study is needed to understand what this means in practical user-interface terms.

Performance and memory/disk usage quickly became a problem because CRDTs store all history, including character-by-character text edits. These pile up, but can’t easily be truncated because it’s impossible to know when someone might reconnect to your shared document after six months away and need to merge changes from that point forward.\nWe continue to optimize Automerge, but this is a major area of ongoing work.

On one hand, these technologies are nowhere near production-ready: [NAT traversal](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389), in particular, is unreliable depending on the particular router or network topology where the user is currently connected. But the promise suggested by P2P protocols and the [Decentralized Web](https://decentralizedweb.net) community is substantial. Live collaboration between computers without Internet access feels like magic in a world that has come to depend on centralized APIs.

This is excellent for privacy and ownership, but can result in situations where a user shares a document, and then closes their laptop lid before the other user has connected. If the users are not online at the same time, they cannot connect to each other.\nServers thus have a role to play in the local-first world — not as central authorities, but as “cloud peers” that support client applications without being on the critical path. For example, a cloud peer that stores a copy of the document, and forwards it to other peers when they come online, could solve the closed-laptop problem above.

Perfectionism is a problem when you become very critical of yourself when you don’t meet your personal standards. People with perfectionism usually focus on the negatives and notice only the occasions when they don’t meet their standards, not those when they do.  ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076PJ1PW9&location=226))\n\n---\nIf you are someone with unhelpful perfectionism, you will tend to judge your self-worth on what you do, not who you are.

It is because of this complexity that it may be hard for you to see yourself as someone with unhelpful perfectionism while those around you can see it more easily.  ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076PJ1PW9&location=318))\n\n---\nFor many, a big part of their worry is that the outcome is not clear or may not be known for a while. The worst part of the situation can be the ‘not knowing’. This ‘intolerance of uncertainty’ is typical of people who have generalised anxiety disorder, as well as those who suffer from perfectionism. If you think that you are struggling with an inability to tolerate uncertainty, then it is worth looking at some of the excellent work by Michel Dugas and colleagues on this topic (see reference list).  ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076PJ1PW9&location=389))\n\n---\nTo make the situation worse, it often happens that when you start to become lower in your mood or depressed, you lack motivation or drive to do things that you normally would do. As a result you may start to engage in some of the unhelpful behaviour we will discuss in more detail later in this chapter, such as procrastination or avoidance. This might then lead to your failing to meet your standards in consequence, which in turn might lead to an increase in depression and even more rumination (overthinking) about how you have not met your standards.  ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076PJ1PW9&location=520))\n\n---\nResearch has found a link between imagery and perfectionism, and a UK study found that people who had high perfectionism also experienced significantly more imagery, found it harder to dismiss images, and had more distress from images related to perfectionism than those with low perfectionism. A larger Australian study found that imagery explained the link between perfectionism and psychological distress to a greater degree than ‘repetitive negative thinking’ (i.e., repeatedly thinking about a negative thought over and over). This research points to the importance of changing negative images which are upsetting and relate to perfectionism concerns.

This is because people may not give a response that makes the person feel reassured, and even if they do, the feeling of reassurance is likely to be only fleeting, after which worry about performance usually kicks back even more strongly than before.

Such information enables you to have choices and, ultimately, freedom.

While there were other factors involved, it is telling that the only large bikeshare system in the United States to fail (Seattle) had to attract ridership in the face of a helmet law.

(See Rule 54  (Location 1544)\n\n---\nRide hailing is amazing for mobility, especially in the suburbs, where few alternatives exist. But there is some question whether ride hailing is good for cities. On the plus side, there is likely a lot less drunk driving. A recent study found that New York City’s four most urban boroughs experienced a 25% to 35% reduction in alcohol-related collisions after the rise of Uber. 97 It is hard to find another cause for this decline, and there is no temptation to do so. Most of us know people who used to drink and drive but now take Uber instead. On the minus side, Uber is bad for transit, and for traffic. As many of New York’s drivers were switching to Uber, so were transit riders. After years of increases, bus ridership has been declining since 2013, subway ridership has been declining since 2016, and street traffic is measurably worse. 98 According to one study, ride-hailing services are responsible for a 3% to 4% jump in traffic citywide, about six hundred million miles per year. 99  (Location 1566)\n\n---\nbecause their principal costs are fixed.) Evidence of a reduction in ownership is starting to trickle in. 103 According to a Reuters poll, approximately 2% of Americans recently ditched their cars thanks to ride hailing. 104 But think about it: if 2%—or even 20%—of Americans drive a bit less, is that enough to make up for the fact that each ride travels 69% farther? Environmentalists who support ride hailing are not doing this math.  (Location 1629)\n\n---\nHistory would suggest that the widely held vision of swarming public fleets, uninterrupted by private and non-autonomous cars, is unlikely to happen in the United States, where no city has ever shown the willingness to limit private car use in any meaningful way, despite crippling traffic. Unlike in less libertarian countries, American cities must plan for incomplete, uncoordinated AV adoption.  (Location 1659)\n\n---\nMoreover, cheap automobiles were the principal enabler of suburban sprawl. As autonomy makes it even cheaper to access far-flung locations, there is danger of a second wave of exurban dislocation. Cities that wish to avoid the long-term balance-sheet burden represented by low-density suburbia must double-down on efforts to promote “smart growth,” which mostly means eliminating all hidden subsidies for sprawl.  (Location 1672)\n\n---\nThis is not by accident. Traffic engineers are still taught that the way to make a road safe is to design it for speeds higher than the posted speed limit. This approach makes sense in theory, until one realizes that there are humans involved. When humans see a street designed for a higher speed, they drive a higher speed, and the road becomes more dangerous.  (Location 2114)\n\n---\nWhy are multilane one-way streets so bad for business? First, there is the speed and the jockeying of the cars. Second is the visibility problem: stores on cross streets whose facades face the direction of flow are never seen by passing drivers (think about it). Finally, one-ways create a feast-or-famine scenario depending on whether a street is on the morning or evening commute. Restaurants and bars will not thrive on a one-way that is inbound; few people dine or drink (we hope) on the way to work.

You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful. It’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening. Unless someone points it out, you may not notice that you cover your mouth with your hand whenever you laugh, that you apologize before asking a question, or that you have a habit of finishing other people’s sentences. And the more you repeat these patterns, the less likely you become to question what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.

Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong. My wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in her packing list. “I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses.

There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. For this exercise, categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run. Generally speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative outcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior.

Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.

This method, which was created by BJ Fogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an obvious cue for nearly any habit.15 fn2 The habit stacking formula is: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” For example: ■ Meditation.

It can be hard to study in the living room without getting distracted if that’s where you always play video games. But when you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind.13 You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to form without interruption.

My apartment is the size of a smartphone. I need each room to play multiple roles.” Fair enough. If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces.

If you’re overweight, a smoker, or an addict, you’ve been told your entire life that it is because you lack self-control—maybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture. Recent research, however, shows something different. When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.5 The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often.6 So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.

Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy. In the short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put it bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.

You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control.

Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation.

The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.

If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible. Missing one workout happens, but I’m not going to miss two in a row. Maybe I’ll eat an entire pizza, but I’ll follow it up with a healthy meal. I can’t be perfect, but I can avoid a second lapse. As soon as one streak ends, I get started on the next one. The first mistake is never the one that ruins you.7 It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident.8 Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

Our deeply rooted preferences make certain behaviors easier for some people than for others.15 You don’t have to apologize for these differences or feel guilty about them, but you do have to work with them.

In theory, you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you. People who are talented in a particular area tend to be more competent at that task and are then praised for doing a good job. They stay energized because they are making progress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them happier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work.

We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty. Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a never-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next, one diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon as we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy—even if the old one was still working. As Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”6 Perhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those that provide continuous forms of novelty. Video games provide visual novelty. Porn provides sexual novelty. Junk foods provide culinary novelty. Each of these experiences offer continual elements of surprise.

To-do lists also can obscure what’s really important. We’re all susceptible to choosing the path of least resistance, especially when we’re tired, stressed, overwhelmed, or just plain busy.

When you don’t have a plan, you have to decide constantly what to do next, and you might get distracted thinking about all the things you should or could do. But a completely planned day provides the freedom to focus on the moment. Instead of thinking about what to do next, you’re free to focus on how to do it.

Ideally, your former leader did a fine job of translating corporate vision into regionally relevant goals. Ideally, her daily direction for the group was aligned with the direction of external groups and those of whoever steps in to fill her spot. But maybe it wasn’t. There’s shielding the team from politics and nonessential crap that they don’t need to know so they can focus on getting work done, but there’s also shielding to an unnecessary degree.

Chess is a well-defined form of computation. You may not be able to work out the answers, but in theory there must be a solution, a right procedure in any position. Now, real games,’ he said, ‘are not like that at all. Real life is not like that. Real life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of deception, of asking yourself what is the other man going to think I mean to do. And that is what games are about in my theory.’”  ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=345))\n\n---\nPoker, in contrast, is a game of incomplete information. It is a game of decision-making under conditions of uncertainty over time. (Not coincidentally, that is close to the definition of game theory.) Valuable information remains hidden. There is also an element of luck in any outcome. You could make the best possible decision at every point and still lose the hand, because you don’t know what new cards will be dealt and revealed. Once the game is finished and you try to learn from the results, separating the quality of your decisions from the influence of luck is difficult.  ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=362))\n\n---\nBut life is more like poker. You could make the smartest, most careful decision in firing a company president and still have it blow up in your face. You could run a red light and get through the intersection safely—or follow all the traffic rules and signals and end up in an accident. You could teach someone the rules of poker in five minutes, put them at a table with a world champion player, deal a hand (or several), and the novice could beat the champion. That could never happen in chess.  ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=369))\n\n---\nThat’s chess, but life doesn’t look like that. It looks more like poker, where all that uncertainty gives us the room to deceive ourselves and misinterpret the data. Poker gives us the leeway to make mistakes that we never spot because we win the hand anyway and so don’t go looking for them, or the leeway to do everything right, still lose, and treat the losing result as proof that we made a mistake. Resulting, assuming that our decision-making is good or bad based on a small set of outcomes, is a pretty reasonable strategy for learning in chess. But not in poker—or life.

A great decision is the result of a good process, and that process must include an attempt to accurately represent our own state of knowledge. That state of knowledge, in turn, is some variation of “I’m not sure.” “I’m not sure” does not mean that there is no objective truth. Firestein’s point is, in fact, that acknowledging uncertainty is the first step in executing on our goal to get closer to what is objectively true.

They understand that they can almost never know exactly how something will turn out. They embrace that uncertainty and, instead of focusing on being sure, they try to figure out how unsure they are, making their best guess at the chances that different outcomes will occur.

Abstract belief formation (that is, beliefs outside our direct experience, conveyed through language) is likely among the few things that are uniquely human, making it relatively new in the scope of evolutionary time. Before language, our ancestors could form new beliefs only through what they directly experienced of the physical world around them. For perceptual beliefs from direct sensory experience, it’s reasonable to presume our senses aren’t lying. Seeing is, after all, believing.

The question that the executive faced (should I invest in Ford stock?) was difficult, but the answer to an easier and related question (do I like Ford cars?) came readily to his mind and determined his choice. This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.  ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=202))\n\n---\nSystem 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.  ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=275))\n\n---\nAs a way to live your life, however, continuous vigilance is not necessarily good, and it is certainly impractical. Constantly questioning our own thinking would be impossibly tedious, and System 2 is much too slow and inefficient to serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions. The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high. The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.  ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=404))\n\n---\nThe main finding was that the ability to detect and report the target letter changed in the course of the 10 seconds of the exercise. The observers almost never missed a K that was shown at the beginning or near the end of the Add-1 task but they missed the target almost half the time when mental effort was at its peak, although we had pictures of their wide-open eye staring straight at it. Failures of detection followed the same inverted-V pattern as the dilating pupil.  ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=500))\n\n---\nNow suppose that at the end of the page you get another instruction: count all the commas in the next page. This will be harder, because you will have to overcome the newly acquired tendency to focus attention on the letter f. One of the significant discoveries of cognitive psychologists in recent decades is that switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure. The need for rapid switching is one of the reasons that Add-3 and mental multiplication are so difficult.  ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=553))\n\n---\nModern tests of working memory require the individual to switch repeatedly between two demanding tasks, retaining the results of one operation while performing the other. People who do well on these tests tend to do well on tests of general intelligence.  ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=559))\n\n---\nIt is normally easy and actually quite pleasant to walk and think at the same time, but at the extremes these activities appear to compete for the limited resources of System 2. You can confirm this claim by a simple experiment. While walking comfortably with a friend, ask him to compute 23 × 78 in his head, and to do so immediately. He will almost certainly stop in his tracks. My experience is that I can think while strolling but cannot engage in mental work that imposes a heavy load on short-term memory.  ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=589))\n\n---\nEven in the absence of time pressure, maintaining a coherent train of thought requires discipline. An observer of the number of times I look at e-mail or investigate the refrigerator during an hour of writing could reasonably infer an urge to escape and conclude that keeping at it requires more self-control than I can readily muster.  ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=603))\n\n---\nBaumeister’s group has repeatedly found that an effort of will or self-control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. The phenomenon has been named ego depletion. In a typical demonstration, participants who are instructed to stifle their emotional reaction to an emotionally charged film will later perform poorly on a test of physical stamina—how long they can maintain a strong grip on a dynamometer in spite of increasing discomfort. The emotional effort in the first phase of the experiment reduces the ability to withstand the pain of sustained muscle contraction, and ego-depleted people therefore succumb more quickly to the urge to quit.  ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=628))\n\n**Tags:** [[favorite]] \n\n---\nUnlike cognitive load, ego depletion is at least in part a loss of motivation. After exerting self-control in one task, you do not feel like making an effort in another, although you could do it if you really had to. In several experiments, people were able to resist the effects of ego depletion when given a strong incentive to do so. In contrast, increasing effort is not an option when you must keep six digits in short-term memory while performing a task. Ego depletion is not the same mental state as cognitive busyness.  ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=646))\n\n---\nThe bat-and-ball problem is our first encounter with an observation that will be a recurrent theme of this book: many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible.  ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=690))\n\n---\nFrederick’s findings suggest that the characters of our psychodrama have different “personalities.” System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy. We recognize related differences among individuals: some people are more like their System 2; others are closer to their System 1. This simple test has emerged as one of the better predictors of lazy thinking.  ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=754))\n\n---\nHowever, Stanovich argues that high intelligence does not make people immune to biases. Another ability is involved, which he labels rationality. Stanovich’s concept of a rational person is similar to what I earlier labeled “engaged.” The core of his argument is that rationality should be distinguished from intelligence. In his view, superficial or “lazy” thinking is a flaw in the reflective mind, a failure of rationality. This is an attractive and thought-provoking idea. In support of it, Stanovich and his colleagues have found that the bat-and-ball question and others like it are somewhat better indicators of our susceptibility to cognitive errors than are conventional measures of intelligence, such as IQ tests. Time will tell whether the distinction between intelligence and rationality can lead to new discoveries.  ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=765))\n\n---\nIn the 1980s, psychologists discovered that exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked. If you have recently seen or heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen, of course, if you had just seen WASH. We call this a priming effect and say that the idea of EAT primes the idea of SOUP, and that WASH primes SOAP.  ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=829))\n\n---\nThe idea you should focus on, however, is that disbelief is not an option. The results are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have no choice but to accept that the major conclusions of these studies are true. More important, you must accept that they are true about you. If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger. You do not believe that these results apply to you because they correspond to nothing in your subjective experience. But your subjective experience consists largely of the story that your System 2 tells itself about what is going on. Priming phenomena arise in System 1, and you have no conscious access to them.  ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=912))\n\n---\nA reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact. But it was psychologists who discovered that you do not have to repeat the entire statement of a fact or idea to make it appear true. People who were repeatedly exposed to the phrase “the body temperature of a chicken” were more likely to accept as true the statement that “the body temperature of a chicken is 144°” (or any other arbitrary number). The familiarity of one phrase in the statement sufficed to make the whole statement feel familiar, and therefore true.  ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1002))\n\n---\nHow do you know that a statement is true? If it is strongly linked by logic or association to other beliefs or preferences you hold, or comes from a source you trust and like, you will feel a sense of cognitive ease. The trouble is that there may be other causes for your feeling of ease—including the quality of the font and the appealing rhythm of the prose—and you have no simple way of tracing your feelings to their source. This is the message of figure 5: the sense of ease or strain has multiple causes, and it is difficult to tease them apart. Difficult, but not impossible. People can overcome some of the superficial factors that produce illusions of truth when strongly motivated to do so. On most occasions, however, the lazy System 2 will adopt the suggestions of System 1 and march on.  ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1037))\n\n---\nThey found that putting the participants in a good mood before the test by having them think happy thoughts more than doubled accuracy. An even more striking result is that unhappy subjects were completely incapable of performing the intuitive task accurately; their guesses were no better than random. Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition.  ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1119))\n\n---\n“How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?” The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the “Moses illusion.” Moses took no animals into the ark; Noah did. Like the incident of the wincing soup eater, the Moses illusion is readily explained by norm theory. The idea of animals going into the ark sets up a biblical context, and Moses is not abnormal in that context. You did not positively expect him, but the mention of his name is not surprising.  ([Location 1197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1197))\n\n---\nThe psychologist Daniel Gilbert, widely known as the author of Stumbling to Happiness, once wrote an essay, titled “How Mental Systems Believe,” in which he developed a theory of believing and unbelieving that he traced to the seventeenth-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Gilbert proposed that understanding a statement must begin with an attempt to believe it: you must first know what the idea would mean if it were true. Only then can you decide whether or not to unbelieve it.  ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1317))\n\n---\nIf you like the president’s politics, you probably like his voice and his appearance as well. The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person—including things you have not observed—is known as the halo effect.  ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1340))\n\n---\nIn an enduring classic of psychology, Solomon Asch presented descriptions of two people and asked for comments on their personality. What do you think of Alan and Ben? Alan: intelligent—industrious—impulsive—critical—stubborn—envious Ben: envious—stubborn—critical—impulsive—industrious—intelligent If you are like most of us, you viewed Alan much more favorably than Ben. The initial traits in the list change the very meaning of the traits that appear later. The stubbornness of an intelligent person is seen as likely to be justified and may actually evoke respect, but intelligence in an envious and stubborn person makes him more dangerous.  ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1351))\n\n---\nWe asked ourselves how people manage to make judgments of probability without knowing precisely what probability is. We concluded that people must somehow simplify that impossible task, and we set out to find how they do it. Our answer was that when called upon to judge probability, people actually judge something else and believe they have judged probability. System 1 often makes this move when faced with difficult target questions, if the answer to a related and easier heuristic question comes readily to mind.  ([Location 1615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1615))\n\n---\n“Do we still remember the question we are trying to answer? Or have we substituted an easier one?” “The question we face is whether this candidate can succeed. The question we seem to answer is whether she interviews well. Let’s not substitute.”  ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1719))\n\n---\nIn our article on representativeness, Amos and I cited the statistician William Feller, who illustrated the ease with which people see patterns where none exists. During the intensive rocket bombing of London in World War II, it was generally believed that the bombing could not be random because a map of the hits revealed conspicuous gaps. Some suspected that German spies were located in the unharmed areas. A careful statistical analysis revealed that the distribution of hits was typical of a random process—and typical as well in evoking a strong impression that it was not random. “To the untrained eye,” Feller remarks, “randomness appears as regularity or tendency to cluster.”  ([Location 1873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1873))\n\n---\nStatistics produce many observations that appear to beg for causal explanations but do not lend themselves to such explanations. Many facts of the world are due to chance, including accidents of sampling. Causal explanations of chance events are inevitably wrong.  ([Location 1921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1921))\n\n---\nThe phenomenon we were studying is so common and so important in the everyday world that you should know its name: it is an anchoring effect. It occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. What happens is one of the most reliable and robust results of experimental psychology: the estimates stay close to the number that people considered—hence the image of an anchor. If you are asked whether Gandhi was more than 114 years old when he died you will end up with a much higher estimate of his age at death than you would if the anchoring question referred to death at 35.  ([Location 1941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1941))\n\n**Tags:** [[favorite]] \n\n---\nEpley and Gilovich also confirmed that adjustment is an effortful operation. People adjust less (stay closer to the anchor) when their mental resources are depleted, either because their memory is loaded with digits or because they are slightly drunk. Insufficient adjustment is a failure of a weak or lazy System 2.  ([Location 1980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1980))\n\n---\nThe power of random anchors has been demonstrated in some unsettling ways. German judges with an average of more than fifteen years of experience on the bench first read a description of a woman who had been caught shoplifting, then rolled a pair of dice that were loaded so every roll resulted in either a 3 or a 9. As soon as the dice came to a stop, the judges were asked whether they would sentence the woman to a term in prison greater or lesser, in months, than the number showing on the dice. Finally, the judges were instructed to specify the exact prison sentence they would give to the shoplifter. On average, those who had rolled a 9 said they would sentence her to 8 months; those who rolled a 3 said they would sentence her to 5 months; the anchoring effect was 50%.  ([Location 2053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=2053))\n\n---\nFinally, try your hand at working out the effect of anchoring on a problem of public policy: the size of damages in personal injury cases. These awards are sometimes very large. Businesses that are frequent targets of such lawsuits, such as hospitals and chemical companies, have lobbied to set a cap on the awards. Before you read this chapter you might have thought that capping awards is certainly good for potential defendants, but now you should not be so sure. Consider the effect of capping awards at $1 million. This rule would eliminate all larger awards, but the anchor would also pull up the size of many awards that would otherwise be much smaller.  ([Location 2079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=2079))\n\n---\nAnchoring effects are threatening in a similar way. You are always aware of the anchor and even pay attention to it, but you do not know how it guides and constrains your thinking, because you cannot imagine how you would have thought if the anchor had been different (or absent). However, you should assume that any number that is on the table has had an anchoring effect on you, and if the stakes are high you should mobilize yourself (your System 2) to combat the effect.  ([Location 2101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=2101))\n\n---\nA professor at UCLA found an ingenious way to exploit the availability bias. He asked different groups of students to list ways to improve the course, and he varied the required number of improvements. As expected, the students who listed more ways to improve the class rated it higher!  ([Location 2189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=2189))\n\n---\nThe striking finding was that people who had received a message extolling the benefits of a technology also changed their beliefs about its risks. Although they had received no relevant evidence, the technology they now liked more than before was also perceived as less risky. Similarly, respondents who were told only that the risks of a technology were mild developed a more favorable view of its benefits. The implication is clear: as the psychologist Jonathan Haidt said in another context, “The emotional tail wags the rational dog.” The affect heuristic simplifies our lives by creating a world that is much tidier than reality. Good technologies have few costs in the imaginary world we inhabit, bad technologies have no benefits, and all decisions are easy. In the real world, of course, we often face painful tradeoffs between benefits and costs.  ([Location 2294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=2294))\n\n---\nThe Alar tale illustrates a basic limitation in the ability of our mind to deal with small risks: we either ignore them altogether or give them far too much weight—nothing in between. Every parent who has stayed up waiting for a teenage daughter who is late from a party will recognize the feeling. You may know that there is really (almost) nothing to worry about, but you cannot help images of disaster from coming to mind. As Slovic has argued, the amount of concern is not adequately sensitive to the probability of harm; you are imagining the numerator—the tragic story you saw on the news—and not thinking about the denominator.  ([Location 2369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=2369))\n\n---\nOne sin of representativeness is an excessive willingness to predict the occurrence of unlikely (low base-rate) events. Here is an example: you see a person reading The New York Times on the New York subway. Which of the following is a better bet about the reading stranger? She has a PhD. She does not have a college degree. Representativeness would tell you to bet on the PhD, but this is not necessarily wise. You should seriously consider the second alternative, because many more nongraduates than PhDs ride in New York subways.

Linda is a bank teller. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement. This stark version of the problem made Linda famous in some circles, and it earned us years of controversy. About 85% to 90% of undergraduates at several major universities chose the second option, contrary to logic.

As expected, probability judgments were higher for the richer and more detailed scenario, contrary to logic. This is a trap for forecasters and their clients: adding detail to scenarios makes them more persuasive, but less likely to come true.

Jane is a teacher and walks to work. The two questions have the same logical structure as the Linda problem, but they cause no fallacy, because the more detailed outcome is only more detailed—it is not more plausible, or more coherent, or a better story. The evaluation of plausibility and coherence does not suggest an answer to the probability question. In the absence of a competing intuition, logic prevails.  ([Location 2642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=2642))\n\n---\nThe Linda problem and the dinnerware problem have exactly the same structure. Probability, like economic value, is a sum-like variable, as illustrated by this example: probability (Linda is a teller) = probability (Linda is feminist teller) + probability (Linda is non-feminist teller) This is also why, as in Hsee’s dinnerware study, single evaluations of the Linda problem produce a less-is-more pattern. System 1 averages instead of adding, so when the non-feminist bank tellers are removed from the set, subjective probability increases. However, the sum-like nature of the variable is less obvious for probability than for money. As a result, joint evaluation eliminates the error only in Hsee’s experiment, not in the Linda experiment.

Not everyone will share this particular vivid imagery, but many subsequent experiments have shown that the frequency representation, as it is known, makes it easy to appreciate that one group is wholly included in the other. The solution to the puzzle appears to be that a question phrased as “how many?” makes you think of individuals, but the same question phrased as “what percentage?” does not.  ([Location 2708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=2708))\n\n---\nThe laziness of System 2 is part of the story. If their next vacation had depended on it, and if they had been given indefinite time and told to follow logic and not to answer until they were sure of their answer, I believe that most of our subjects would have avoided the conjunction fallacy. However, their vacation did not depend on a correct answer; they spent very little time on it, and were content to answer as if they had only been “asked for their opinion.” The laziness of System 2 is an important fact of life, and the observation that representativeness can block the application of an obvious logical rule is also of some interest.  ([Location 2718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=2718))\n\n---\nThe cab example illustrates two types of base rates. Statistical base rates are facts about a population to which a case belongs, but they are not relevant to the individual case. Causal base rates change your view of how the individual case came to be. The two types of base-rate information are treated differently: Statistical base rates are generally underweighted, and sometimes neglected altogether, when specific information about the case at hand is available. Causal base rates are treated as information about the individual case and are easily combined with other case-specific information.

Naturally, he praised only a cadet whose performance was far better than average. But the cadet was probably just lucky on that particular attempt and therefore likely to deteriorate regardless of whether or not he was praised. Similarly, the instructor would shout into a cadet’s earphones only when the cadet’s performance was unusually bad and therefore likely to improve regardless of what the instructor did. The instructor had attached a causal interpretation to the inevitable fluctuations of a random process.

This is the most you can say: The golfer who did well on day 1 is likely to be successful on day 2 as well, but less than on the first, because the unusual luck he probably enjoyed on day 1 is unlikely to hold. The golfer who did poorly on day 1 will probably be below average on day 2, but will improve, because his probable streak of bad luck is not likely to continue.

Overconfidence and the pressure of meeting high expectations are often offered as explanations. But there is a simpler account of the jinx: an athlete who gets to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated must have performed exceptionally well in the preceding season, probably with the assistance of a nudge from luck—and luck is fickle.

([Location 3215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=3215))\n\n---\nHindsight bias has pernicious effects on the evaluations of decision makers. It leads observers to assess the quality of a decision not by whether the process was sound but by whether its outcome was good or bad. Consider a low-risk surgical intervention in which an unpredictable accident occurred that caused the patient’s death. The jury will be prone to believe, after the fact, that the operation was actually risky and that the doctor who ordered it should have known better. This outcome bias makes it almost impossible to evaluate a decision properly—in terms of the beliefs that were reasonable when the decision was made.  ([Location 3360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=3360))\n\n---\nNot surprisingly, Meehl’s book provoked shock and disbelief among clinical psychologists, and the controversy it started has engendered a stream of research that is still flowing today, more than fifty years after its publication. The number of studies reporting comparisons of clinical and statistical predictions has increased to roughly two hundred, but the score in the contest between algorithms and humans has not changed. About 60% of the studies have shown significantly better accuracy for the algorithms. The other comparisons scored a draw in accuracy, but a tie is tantamount to a win for the statistical rules, which are normally much less expensive to use than expert judgment. No exception has been convincingly documented.  ([Location 3704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=3704))\n\n---\nAccording to Meehl, there are few circumstances under which it is a good idea to substitute judgment for a formula. In a famous thought experiment, he described a formula that predicts whether a particular person will go to the movies tonight and noted that it is proper to disregard the formula if information is received that the individual broke a leg today. The name “broken-leg rule” has stuck. The point, of course, is that broken legs are very rare—as well as decisive.

They call themselves students of Naturalistic Decision Making, or NDM, and mostly work in organizations where they often study how experts work. The NDMers adamantly reject the focus on biases in the heuristics and biases approach. They criticize this model as overly concerned with failures and driven by artificial experiments rather than by the study of real people doing things that matter. They are deeply skeptical about the value of using rigid algorithms to replace human judgment, and Paul Meehl is not among their heroes.  ([Location 3912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=3912))\n\n---\nWe eventually concluded that our disagreement was due in part to the fact that we had different experts in mind. Klein had spent much time with fireground commanders, clinical nurses, and other professionals who have real expertise. I had spent more time thinking about clinicians, stock pickers, and political scientists trying to make unsupportable long-term forecasts. Not surprisingly, his default attitude was trust and respect; mine was skepticism. He was more willing to trust experts who claim an intuition because, as he told me, true experts know the limits of their knowledge. I argued that there are many pseudo-experts who have no idea that they do not know what they are doing (the illusion of validity), and that as a general proposition subjective confidence is commonly too high and often uninformative.  ([Location 3999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=3999))\n\n---\nIf subjective confidence is not to be trusted, how can we evaluate the probable validity of an intuitive judgment? When do judgments reflect true expertise? When do they display an illusion of validity? The answer comes from the two basic conditions for acquiring a skill: an environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable an opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice  ([Location 4011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4011))\n\n---\nSome environments are worse than irregular. Robin Hogarth described “wicked” environments, in which professionals are likely to learn the wrong lessons from experience. He borrows from Lewis Thomas the example of a physician in the early twentieth century who often had intuitions about patients who were about to develop typhoid. Unfortunately, he tested his hunch by palpating the patient’s tongue, without washing his hands between patients. When patient after patient became ill, the physician developed a sense of clinical infallibility. His predictions were accurate—but not because he was exercising professional intuition!

In contrast, radiologists obtain little information about the accuracy of the diagnoses they make and about the pathologies they fail to detect. Anesthesiologists are therefore in a better position to develop useful intuitive skills. If an anesthesiologist says, “I have a feeling something is wrong,” everyone in the operating room should be prepared for an emergency.  ([Location 4052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4052))\n\n---\nThis reasoning leads to a hypothesis: the people who have the greatest influence on the lives of others are likely to be optimistic and overconfident, and to take more risks than they realize.  ([Location 4293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4293))\n\n---\nConfidence is valued over uncertainty and there is a prevailing censure against disclosing uncertainty to patients.” Experts who acknowledge the full extent of their ignorance may expect to be replaced by more confident competitors, who are better able to gain the trust of clients. An unbiased appreciation of uncertainty is a cornerstone of rationality—but it is not what people and organizations want. Extreme uncertainty is paralyzing under dangerous circumstances, and the admission that one is merely guessing is especially unacceptable when the stakes are high. Acting on pretended knowledge is often the preferred solution.  ([Location 4420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4420))\n\n---\nOrganizations may be better able to tame optimism and individuals than individuals are. The best idea for doing so was contributed by Gary Klein, my “adversarial collaborator” who generally defends intuitive decision making against claims of bias and is typically hostile to algorithms. He labels his proposal the premortem. The procedure is simple: when the organization has almost come to an important decision but has not formally committed itself, Klein proposes gathering for a brief session a group of individuals who are knowledgeable about the decision. The premise of the session is a short speech: “Imagine that we are a year into the future. We implemented the plan as it now exists. The outcome was a disaster. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief history of that disaster.”  ([Location 4445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4445))\n\n---\nBernoulli observed that most people dislike risk (the chance of receiving the lowest possible outcome), and if they are offered a choice between a gamble and an amount equal to its expected value they will pick the sure thing. In fact a risk-averse decision maker will choose a sure thing that is less than expected value, in effect paying a premium to avoid the uncertainty.  ([Location 4548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4548))\n\n---\nBecause Bernoulli’s model lacks the idea of a reference point, expected utility theory does not represent the obvious fact that the outcome that is good for Anthony is bad for Betty. His model could explain Anthony’s risk aversion, but it cannot explain Betty’s risk-seeking preference for the gamble, a behavior that is often observed in entrepreneurs and in generals when all their options are bad.  ([Location 4606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4606))\n\n---\nThe four problems highlight the weakness of Bernoulli’s model. His theory is too simple and lacks a moving part. The missing variable is the reference point, the earlier state relative to which gains and losses are evaluated. In Bernoulli’s theory you need to know only the state of wealth to determine its utility, but in prospect theory you also need to know the reference state. Prospect theory is therefore more complex than utility theory.  ([Location 4691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4691))\n\n---\nYou can measure the extent of your aversion to losses by asking yourself a question: What is the smallest gain that I need to balance an equal chance to lose $100? For many people the answer is about $200, twice as much as the loss. The “loss aversion ratio” has been estimated in several experiments and is usually in the range of 1.5 to 2.5. This is an average, of course; some people are much more loss averse than others. Professional risk takers in the financial markets are more tolerant of losses, probably because they do not respond emotionally to every fluctuation.  ([Location 4728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4728))\n\n---\nRicher and more realistic assumptions do not suffice to make a theory successful. Scientists use theories as a bag of working tools, and they will not take on the burden of a heavier bag unless the new tools are very useful. Prospect theory was accepted by many scholars not because it is “true” but because the concepts that it added to utility theory, notably the reference point and loss aversion, were worth the trouble; they yielded new predictions that turned out to be true. We were lucky.  ([Location 4806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4806))\n\n---\nThis example highlights two aspects of choice that the standard model of indifference curves does not predict. First, tastes are not fixed; they vary with the reference point. Second, the disadvantages of a change loom larger than its advantages, inducing a bias that favors the status quo. Of course, loss aversion does not imply that you never prefer to change your situation; the benefits of an opportunity may exceed even overweighted losses. Loss aversion implies only that choices are strongly biased in favor of the reference situation (and generally biased to favor small rather than large changes).  ([Location 4859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4859))\n\n---\nThe solution was to abandon the standard idea that Professor R had a unique utility for the state of having a particular bottle. Prospect theory suggested that the willingness to buy or sell the bottle depends on the reference point—whether or not the professor owns the bottle now. If he owns it, he considers the pain of giving up the bottle. If he does not own it, he considers the pleasure of getting the bottle. The values were unequal because of loss aversion: giving up a bottle of nice wine is more painful than getting an equally good bottle is pleasurable.  ([Location 4887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4887))\n\n---\nRecent studies of the psychology of “decision making under poverty” suggest that the poor are another group in which we do not expect to find the endowment effect. Being poor, in prospect theory, is living below one’s reference point. There are goods that the poor need and cannot afford, so they are always “in the losses.” Small amounts of money that they receive are therefore perceived as a reduced loss, not as a gain. The money helps one climb a little toward the reference point, but the poor always remain on the steep limb of the value function.  ([Location 4980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=4980))\n\n---\nThe information about the threat probably traveled via a superfast neural channel that feeds directly into a part of the brain that processes emotions, bypassing the visual cortex that supports the conscious experience of “seeing.” The same circuit also causes schematic angry faces (a potential threat) to be processed faster and more efficiently than schematic happy faces. Some experimenters have reported that an angry face “pops out” of a crowd of happy faces, but a single happy face does not stand out in an angry crowd.

Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones.” They cite John Gottman, the well-known expert in marital relations, who observed that the long-term success of a relationship depends far more on avoiding the negative than on seeking the positive. Gottman estimated that a stable relationship requires that good interactions outnumber bad interactions by at least 5 to 1.

Those who stand to lose will fight harder than those who stand to gain.”  ([Location 5164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=5164))\n\n---\nMany unfortunate human situations unfold in the top right cell. This is where people who face very bad options take desperate gambles, accepting a high probability of making things worse in exchange for a small hope of avoiding a large loss. Risk taking of this kind often turns manageable failures into disasters. The thought of accepting the large sure loss is too painful, and the hope of complete relief too enticing, to make the sensible decision that it is time to cut one’s losses. This is where businesses that are losing ground to a superior technology waste their remaining assets in futile attempts to catch up. Because defeat is so difficult to accept, the losing side in wars often fights long past the point at which the victory of the other side is certain, and only a matter of time.  ([Location 5331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=5331))\n\n---\nThe decisions described by the fourfold pattern are not obviously unreasonable. You can empathize in each case with the feelings of the plaintiff and the defendant that lead them to adopt a combative or an accommodating posture. In the long run, however, deviations from expected value are likely to be costly. Consider a large organization, the City of New York, and suppose it faces 200 “frivolous” suits each year, each with a 5% chance to cost the city $1 million. Suppose further that in each case the city could settle the lawsuit for a payment of $100,000. The city considers two alternative policies that it will apply to all such cases: settle or go to trial. (For simplicity, I ignore legal costs.) If the city litigates all 200 cases, it will lose 10, for a total loss of $10 million. If the city settles every case for $100,000, its total loss will be $20 million. When you take the long view of many similar decisions, you can see that paying a premium to avoid a small risk of a large loss is costly. A similar analysis applies to each of the cells of the fourfold pattern: systematic deviations from expected value are costly in the long run—and this rule applies to both risk aversion and risk seeking. Consistent overweighting of improbable outcomes—a feature of intuitive decision making—eventually leads to inferior outcomes.  ([Location 5364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=5364))\n\n---\nNow I have a sermon ready for Sam if he rejects the offer of a single highly favorable gamble played once, and for you if you share his unreasonable aversion to losses: I sympathize with your aversion to losing any gamble, but it is costing you a lot of money. Please consider this question: Are you on your deathbed? Is this the last offer of a small favorable gamble that you will ever consider? Of course, you are unlikely to be offered exactly this gamble again, but you will have many opportunities to consider attractive gambles with stakes that are very small relative to your wealth. You will do yourself a large financial favor if you are able to see each of these gambles as part of a bundle of small gambles and rehearse the mantra that will get you significantly closer to economic rationality: you win a few, you lose a few. The main purpose of the mantra is to control your emotional response when you do lose. If you can trust it to be effective, you should remind yourself of it when deciding whether or not to accept a small risk with positive expected value. Remember these qualifications when using the mantra: It works when the gambles are genuinely independent of each other; it does not apply to multiple investments in the same industry, which would all go bad together. It works only when the possible loss does not cause you to worry about your total wealth. If you would take the loss as significant bad news about your economic future, watch it! It should not be applied to long shots, where the probability of winning is very small for each bet. If you have the emotional discipline that this rule requires, you will never consider a small gamble in isolation or be loss averse for a small gamble until you are actually on your deathbed—and not even then.

He asked them to consider a risky option in which, with equal probabilities, they could lose a large amount of the capital they controlled or earn double that amount. None of the executives was willing to take such a dangerous gamble. Thaler then turned to the CEO of the company, who was also present, and asked for his opinion. Without hesitation, the CEO answered, “I would like all of them to accept their risks.” In the context of that conversation, it was natural for the CEO to adopt a broad frame that encompassed all 25 bets. Like Sam facing 100 coin tosses, he could count on statistical aggregation to mitigate the overall risk.  ([Location 5716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=5716))\n\n---\nThe escalation of commitment to failing endeavors is a mistake from the perspective of the firm but not necessarily from the perspective of the executive who “owns” a floundering project. Canceling the project will leave a permanent stain on the executive’s record, and his personal interests are perhaps best served by gambling further with the organization’s resources in the hope of recouping the original investment—or at least in an attempt to postpone the day of reckoning. In the presence of sunk costs, the manager’s incentives are misaligned with the objectives of the firm and its shareholders, a familiar type of what is known as the agency problem. Boards of directors are well aware of these conflicts and often replace a CEO who is encumbered by prior decisions and reluctant to cut losses. The members of the board do not necessarily believe that the new CEO is more competent than the one she replaces. They do know that she does not carry the same mental accounts and is therefore better able to ignore the sunk costs of past investments in evaluating current opportunities.

The result illustrates Hsee’s evaluability hypothesis: The number of entries is given no weight in single evaluation, because the numbers are not “evaluable” on their own. In joint evaluation, in contrast, it is immediately obvious that dictionary B is superior on this attribute, and it is also apparent that the number of entries is far more important than the condition of the cover.

The wording was intended to encourage them to think of the integral of the pain they had reported, reproducing the hedonimeter totals. Surprisingly, the patients did nothing of the kind. The statistical analysis revealed two findings, which illustrate a pattern we have observed in other experiments: Peak-end rule: The global retrospective rating was well predicted by the average of the level of pain reported at the worst moment of the experience and at its end. Duration neglect: The duration of the procedure had no effect whatsoever on the ratings of total pain.  ([Location 6366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=6366))\n\n---\nIf the objective is to reduce patients’ memory of pain, lowering the peak intensity of pain could be more important than minimizing the duration of the procedure. By the same reasoning, gradual relief may be preferable to abrupt relief if patients retain a better memory when the pain at the end of the procedure is relatively mild. If the objective is to reduce the amount of pain actually experienced, conducting the procedure swiftly may be appropriate even if doing so increases the peak pain intensity and leaves patients with an awful memory.  ([Location 6380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=6380))\n\n---\nThe preferences we observed in this experiment are another example of the less-is-more effect that we have encountered on previous occasions. One was Christopher Hsee’s study in which adding dishes to a set of 24 dishes lowered the total value because some of the added dishes were broken. Another was Linda, the activist woman who is judged more likely to be a feminist bank teller than a bank teller. The similarity is not accidental. The same operating feature of System 1 accounts for all three situations: System 1 represents sets by averages, norms, and prototypes, not by sums. Each cold-hand episode is a set of moments, which the remembering self stores as a prototypical moment. This leads to a conflict. For an objective observer evaluating the episode from the reports of the experiencing self, what counts is the “area under the curve” that integrates pain over time; it has the nature of a sum. The memory that the remembering self keeps, in contrast, is a representative moment, strongly influenced by the peak and the end.

To appreciate how strong this illusion is, take a few seconds to consider the question: How much pleasure do you get from your car? An answer came to your mind immediately; you know how much you like and enjoy your car. Now examine a different question: “When do you get pleasure from your car?” The answer to this question may surprise you, but it is straightforward: you get pleasure (or displeasure) from your car when you think about your car, which is probably not very often. Under normal circumstances, you do not spend much time thinking about your car when you are driving it. You think of other things as you drive, and your mood is determined by whatever you think about. Here again, when you tried to rate how much you enjoyed your car, you actually answered a much narrower question: “How much pleasure do you get from your car when you think about it?”  ([Location 6779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=6779))\n\n---\nExcept for some effects that I attribute mostly to age, my intuitive thinking is just as prone to overconfidence, extreme predictions, and the planning fallacy as it was before I made a study of these issues. I have improved only in my ability to recognize situations in which errors are likely: “This number will be an anchor…,” “The decision could change if the problem is reframed…” And I have made much more progress in recognizing the errors of others than my own. The way to block errors that originate in System 1 is simple in principle: recognize the signs that you are in a cognitive minefield, slow down, and ask for reinforcement from System 2.

There’s also an uneasiness that surrounds any effort to produce the best things you’re capable of producing, as this forces you to confront the possibility that your best is not (yet) that good. It’s safer to comment on our culture than to step into the Rooseveltian ring and attempt to wrestle it into something better.

This is especially true for entry-level positions, which, by definition, are not going to be filled with challenging projects and autonomy—these come later.  ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KFR64LQ&location=580))\n\n---\nIn other words, I am suggesting that you put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, and instead turn your focus toward becoming so good they can’t ignore you. That is, regardless of what you do for a living, approach your work like a true performer.  ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KFR64LQ&location=597))\n\n---\nIn which I justify the importance of the craftsman mindset by arguing that the traits that make a great job great are rare and valuable, and therefore, if you want a great job, you need to build up rare and valuable skills—which I call career capital—to offer in return.  ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KFR64LQ&location=625))\n\n---\nTHE CAREER CAPITAL THEORY OF GREAT WORK The traits that define great work are rare and valuable. Supply and demand says that if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your career capital. The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on becoming “so good they can’t ignore you,” is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital. This is why it trumps the passion mindset if your goal is to create work you love.  ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KFR64LQ&location=692))\n\n---\nYou need to get good in order to get good things in your working life, and the craftsman mindset is focused on achieving exactly this goal.  ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KFR64LQ&location=705))\n\n---\nPart of what makes the craftsman mindset thrilling is its agnosticism toward the type of work you do. The traits that define great work are bought with career capital, the theory argues; they don’t come from matching your work to your innate passion. Because of this, you don’t have to sweat whether you’ve found your calling—most any work can become the foundation for a compelling career.  ([Location 784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KFR64LQ&location=784))\n\n---\nA useful heuristic in this situation is to seek open gates—opportunities to build capital that are already open to you. For example, Mike Jackson’s next step after his degree was to work with a Stanford professor on his environmental-policy research. This decision helped Mike acquire a key type of career capital—a nuanced understanding of international energy markets. At the same time, however, keep in mind that this was also an opportunity that was open to Mike because he was already a Stanford student earning a degree in the field. This made it relatively easy for him to jump into this new role. For someone outside of Stanford, by contrast, being put in charge of such an important project would have been a much less likely proposition.

That is what makes it “deliberate,” as distinct from the mindless playing of scales or hitting of tennis balls that most people engage in.  ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KFR64LQ&location=1255))\n\n---\nRule #2 was the first to tackle the natural follow-up question: If “follow your passion” is bad advice, what should you do instead? It contended that the traits that define great work are rare and valuable. If you want these traits in your own life, you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. I called these rare and valuable skills career capital, and noted that the foundation of constructing work you love is acquiring a large store of this capital.  ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KFR64LQ&location=1298))\n\n---\nEven with the craftsman mindset, however, becoming “so good they can’t ignore you” is not trivial. To help these efforts I introduced the well-studied concept of deliberate practice, an approach to work where you deliberately stretch your abilities beyond where you’re comfortable and then receive ruthless feedback on your performance. Musicians, athletes, and chess players know all about deliberate practice. Knowledge workers, however, do not. This is great news for knowledge workers: If you can introduce this strategy into your working life you can vault past your peers in your acquisition of career capital.  ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KFR64LQ&location=1305))\n\n---\nTo summarize, if your goal is to love what you do, your first step is to acquire career capital. Your next step is to invest this capital in the traits that define great work. Control is one of the most important targets you can choose for this investment.  ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KFR64LQ&location=1421))\n\n---\nThe First Control Trap Control that’s acquired without career capital is not sustainable.

But when it comes to decisions affecting your core career, money remains an effective judge of value.

If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.

As I’ll explain, mission is one of these desirable traits, and like any such desirable trait, it too requires that you first build career capital—a mission launched without this expertise is likely doomed to sputter and die.  ([Location 1815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KFR64LQ&location=1815))\n\n---\nIn hindsight, these observations are obvious. If life-transforming missions could be found with just a little navel-gazing and an optimistic attitude, changing the world would be commonplace. But it’s not commonplace; it’s instead quite rare. This rareness, we now understand, is because these breakthroughs require that you first get to the cutting edge, and this is hard—the type of hardness that most of us try to avoid in our working lives.

To maximize your chances of success, you should deploy small, concrete experiments that return concrete feedback. For Chris Rock, such a bet might include telling a joke to an audience and seeing if they laugh, whereas for Kirk, it might mean producing sample footage for a documentary and seeing if it attracts funding. These bets allow you to tentatively explore the specific avenues surrounding your general mission, looking for those with the highest likelihood of leading to outstanding results.

The airline pilot who announces that he is presently anticipating experiencing considerable precipitation wouldn’t think of saying it may rain. The sentence is too simple—there must be something wrong with it.  ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=170))\n\n---\nAs George Orwell pointed out in “Politics and the English Language,” an essay written in 1946 but often cited during the wars in Cambodia, Vietnam and Iraq, “political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.... Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.”  ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=264))\n\n---\nNever say anything in writing that you wouldn’t comfortably say in conversation. If you’re not a person who says “indeed” or “moreover,” or who calls someone an individual (“he’s a fine individual”), please don’t write it.  ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=425))\n\n---\nWe’re still left with the question: What is good usage? One helpful approach is to try to separate usage from jargon. I would say, for example, that “prioritize” is jargon—a pompous new verb that sounds more important than “rank”—and that “bottom line” is usage, a metaphor borrowed from the world of bookkeeping that conveys an image we can picture. As every businessman knows, the bottom line is the one that matters. If someone says, “The bottom line is that we just can’t work together,” we know what he means. I don’t much like the phrase, but the bottom line is that it’s here to stay.  ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=686))\n\n---\nTherefore ask yourself some basic questions before you start. For example: “In what capacity am I going to address the reader?” (Reporter? Provider of information? Average man or woman?) “What pronoun and tense am I going to use?” “What style?” (Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?) “What attitude am I going to take toward the material?” (Involved? Detached? Judgmental? Ironic? Amused?) “How much do I want to cover?” “What one point do I want to make?”  ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=751)) ^a168c3\n\n---\nTherefore your lead must capture the reader immediately and force him to keep reading. It must cajole him with freshness, or novelty, or paradox, or humor, or surprise, or with an unusual idea, or an interesting fact, or a question. Anything will do, as long as it nudges his curiosity and tugs at his sleeve.  ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=795))\n\n---\nMost of us are still prisoners of the lesson pounded into us by the composition teachers of our youth: that every story must have a beginning, a middle and an end. We can still visualize the outline, with its Roman numerals (I, II and III), which staked out the road we would faithfully trudge, and its subnumerals (IIa and IIb) denoting lesser paths down which we would briefly poke. But we always promised to get back to III and summarize our journey. That’s all right for elementary and high school students uncertain of their ground. It forces them to see that every piece of writing should have a logical design. It’s a lesson worth knowing at any age—even professional writers are adrift more often than they would like to admit. But if you’re going to write good nonfiction you must wriggle out of III’s dread grip.  ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=935))\n\n---\nhave another option. They quit. That’s the negative reason for remembering the importance of the last sentence. Failure to know where that sentence should occur can wreck an article that until its final stage has been tightly constructed. The positive reason for ending well is that a good last sentence—or last paragraph—is a joy in itself. It gives the reader a lift, and it lingers when the article is over. The perfect ending should take your readers slightly by surprise and yet seem exactly right. They didn’t expect the article to end so soon, or so abruptly, or to say what it said. But they know it when they see it. Like a good lead, it works. It’s like the curtain line in a theatrical comedy. We are in the middle of a scene (we think), when suddenly one of the actors says something funny, or outrageous, or epigrammatic, and the lights go out. We are startled to find the scene over, and then delighted by the aptness of how it ended. What delights us is the playwright’s perfect control.  ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=948))\n\n---\nFor the nonfiction writer, the simplest way of putting this into a rule is: when you’re ready to stop, stop. If you have presented all the facts and made the point you want to make, look for the nearest exit.  ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=956))\n\n---\nUse active verbs unless there is no comfortable way to get around using a passive verb. The difference between an activeverb style and a passive-verb style—in clarity and vigor—is the difference between life and death for a writer.  ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=988))\n\n---\nADVERBS. Most adverbs are unnecessary. You will clutter your sentence and annoy the reader if you choose a verb that has a specific meaning and then add an adverb that carries the same meaning. Don’t tell us that the radio blared loudly; “blare” connotes loudness. Don’t write that someone clenched his teeth tightly; there’s no other way to clench teeth. Again and again in careless writing, strong verbs are weakened by redundant adverbs. So are adjectives and other parts of speech: “effortlessly easy,” “slightly spartan,” “totally flabbergasted.”  ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=1005))\n\n---\nMost writers sow adjectives almost unconsciously into the soil of their prose to make it more lush and pretty, and the sentences become longer and longer as they fill up with stately elms and frisky kittens and hard-bitten detectives and sleepy lagoons. This is adjective-by-habit—a habit you should get rid of. Not every oak has to be gnarled. The adjective that exists solely as decoration is a self-indulgence for the writer and a burden for the reader.  ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=1023))\n\n---\nDon’t say you weren’t too happy because the hotel was pretty expensive. Say you weren’t happy because the hotel was expensive. Don’t tell us you were quite fortunate. How fortunate is that? Don’t describe an event as rather spectacular or very awesome. Words like “spectacular” and “awesome” don’t submit to measurement. “Very” is a useful word to achieve emphasis, but far more often it’s clutter. There’s no need to call someone very methodical. Either he is methodical or he isn’t.  ([Location 1035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=1035))\n\n---\nThe Dash. Somehow this invaluable tool is widely regarded as not quite proper—a bumpkin at the genteel dinner table of good English. But it has full membership and will get you out of many tight corners. The dash is used in two ways. One is to amplify or justify in the second part of the sentence a thought you stated in the first part. “We decided to keep going—it was only 100 miles more and we could get there in time for dinner.” By its very shape the dash pushes the sentence ahead and explains why they decided to keep going. The other use involves two dashes, which set apart a parenthetical thought within a longer sentence. “She told me to get in the car—she had been after me all summer to have a haircut—and we drove silently into town.” An explanatory detail that might otherwise have required a separate sentence is neatly dispatched along the way.  ([Location 1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=1066))\n\n---\nIf you need relief from too many sentences beginning with “but,” switch to “however.” It is, however, a weaker word and needs careful placement. Don’t start a sentence with “however”—it hangs there like a wet dishrag. And don’t end with “however”—by that time it has lost its howeverness. Put it as early as you reasonably can, as I did three sentences ago. Its abruptness then becomes a virtue.  ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=1083))\n\n---\nAs for “meanwhile,” “now,” “today” and “later,” what they also save is confusion, for careless writers often change their time frame without remembering to tip the reader off. “Now I know better.” “Today you can’t find such an item.” “Later I found out why.” Always make sure your readers are oriented. Always ask yourself where you left them in the previous sentence.  ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=1093))\n\n---\nAlways use “that” unless it makes your meaning ambiguous. Notice that in carefully edited magazines, such as The New Yorker, “that” is by far the predominant usage. I mention this because it is still widely believed—a residue from school and college—that “which” is more correct, more acceptable, more literary. It’s not. In most situations, “that” is what you would naturally say and therefore what you should write.  ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=1106))\n\n---\nRewriting is the essence of writing well: it’s where the game is won or lost. That idea is hard to accept. We all have an emotional equity in our first draft; we can’t believe that it wasn’t born perfect. But the odds are close to 100 percent that it wasn’t. Most writers don’t initially say what they want to say, or say it as well as they could. The newly hatched sentence almost always has something wrong with it. It’s not clear. It’s not logical. It’s verbose. It’s klunky. It’s pretentious. It’s boring. It’s full of clutter. It’s full of clichés. It lacks rhythm. It can be read in several different ways. It doesn’t lead out of the previous sentence. It doesn’t … The point is that clear writing is the result of a lot of tinkering.  ([Location 1244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=1244))\n\n---\nThe chapter is based on a simple principle: writing is not a special language owned by the English teacher. Writing is thinking on paper. Anyone who thinks clearly can write clearly, about anything at all. Science, demystified, is just another nonfiction subject. Writing, demystified, is just another way for scientists to transmit what they know.  ([Location 2159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=2159))\n\n---\nImagine science writing as an upside-down pyramid. Start at the bottom with the one fact a reader must know before he can learn any more. The second sentence broadens what was stated first, making the pyramid wider, and the third sentence broadens the second, so that you can gradually move beyond fact into significance and speculation—how a new discovery alters what was known, what new avenues of research it might open, where the research might be applied. There’s no limit to how wide the pyramid can become, but your readers will understand the broad implications only if they start with one narrow fact.  ([Location 2186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=2186))\n\n---\nYou can take much of the mystery out of science writing by helping the reader to identify with the scientific work being done. Again, this means looking for the human element—and if you have to settle for a chimpanzee, at least that’s the next-highest rung on the Darwinian ladder. One human element is yourself. Use your own experience to connect the reader to some mechanism that also touches his life.  ([Location 2226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=2226))\n\n---\nIf you have to do any writing in your job, this chapter is for you. Just as in science writing, anxiety is a big part of the problem and humanity and clear thinking are a big part of the solution.  ([Location 2422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=2422))\n\n---\nThe columns that I wrote for Life made people laugh. But they had a serious purpose, which was to say: “Something crazy is going on here—some erosion in the quality of life, or some threat to life itself, and yet everyone assumes it’s normal.” Today the outlandish becomes routine overnight. The humorist is trying to say that it’s still outlandish.  ([Location 3090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=3090))\n\n---\nNever hesitate to imitate another writer. Imitation is part of the creative process for anyone learning an art or a craft. Bach and Picasso didn’t spring full-blown as Bach and Picasso; they needed models. This is especially true of writing. Find the best writers in the fields that interest you and read their work aloud. Get their voice and their taste into your ear—their attitude toward language. Don’t worry that by imitating them you’ll lose your own voice and your own identity. Soon enough you will shed those skins and become who you are supposed to become.  ([Location 3426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=3426))\n\n---\nI mention this to give confidence to all nonfiction writers: a point of craft. If you master the tools of the trade—the fundamentals of interviewing and of orderly construction—and if you bring to the assignment your general intelligence and your humanity, you can write about any subject. That’s your ticket to an interesting life.  ([Location 3603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0090RVGW0&location=3603))\n\n---\nLearning how to organize a long article is just as important as learning how to write a clear and pleasing sentence. All your clear and pleasing sentences will fall apart if you don’t keep remembering that writing is linear and sequential, that logic is the glue that holds it together, that tension must be maintained from one sentence to the next and from one paragraph to the next and from one section to the next, and that narrative—good old-fashioned storytelling—is what should pull your readers along without their noticing the tug. The only thing they should notice is that you have made a sensible plan for your journey. Every step should seem inevitable.

You must find some way to elevate your act of writing into an entertainment. Usually this means giving the reader an enjoyable surprise. Any number of devices will do the job: humor, anecdote, paradox, an unexpected quotation, a powerful fact, an outlandish detail, a circuitous approach, an elegant arrangement of words. These seeming amusements in fact become your “style.” When we say we like the style of certain writers, what we mean is that we like their personality as they express it on paper.

In most cases there is no clear separation of two groups, even if it seems like that from the averages. We almost always get a more accurate picture by digging a little deeper and looking not just at the averages but at the spread: not just the group all bundled together, but the individuals. Then we often see that apparently distinct groups are in fact very much overlapping.

There is probably no gap at all. • Beware comparisons of extremes. In all groups, of countries or people, there are some at the top and some at the bottom. The difference is sometimes extremely unfair. But even then the majority is usually somewhere in between, right where the gap is supposed to be. • The view from up here. Remember, looking down from above distorts the view. Everything else looks equally short, but it’s not.

Practice distinguishing between a level (e.g., bad) and a direction of change (e.g., better). Convince yourself that things can be both better and bad. • Good news is not news. Good news is almost never reported. So news is almost always bad. When you see bad news, ask whether equally positive news would have reached you. • Gradual improvement is not news. When a trend is gradually improving, with periodic dips, you are more likely to notice the dips than the overall improvement. • More news does not equal more suffering. More bad news is sometimes due to better surveillance of suffering, not a worsening world. • Beware of rosy pasts.

Ideally, divide by something. • 80/20. Have you been given a long list? Look for the few largest items and deal with those first. They are quite likely more important than all the others put together. • Divide. Amounts and rates can tell very different stories.

But here’s the thing, and it is hard to accept: the evidence does not support this stance. Most countries that make great economic and social progress are not democracies. South Korea moved from Level 1 to Level 3 faster than any country had ever done (without finding oil), all the time as a military dictatorship. Of the ten countries with the fastest economic growth in 2016, nine of them score low on democracy.

For this process to succeed, you must also spend this period trying to rediscover what's important to you and what you enjoy outside the world of the always on, shiny digital. Figuring this out before you begin reintroducing technology at the end of this declutter process is crucial. An argument I'll elaborate on in part 2 of this book is that you're more likely to succeed in reducing the role of digital tools in your life if you cultivate high-quality alternatives to the easy distraction they provide. For many people, their compulsive phone use papers over a void created by a lack of a well-developed leisure life. Reducing the easy distraction without also filling the void can make life unpleasantly stale-an outcome likely to undermine any transition to minimalism.  (Page 71) ^rw490185809\n\n---\nAs Aristotle elaborates, a life filled with deep thinking is happy because contemplation is an \"activity that is appreciated for its own sake . . . nothing is gained from it except the act of contemplation.\" In this offhand claim, Aristotle is identifying, for perhaps the first time in the history of recorded philosophy, an idea that has persisted throughout the intervening understanding millennia and continues to resonate with our of human nature today: a life well lived requires activities that serve no other purpose than the satisfaction that the activity itself generates.\nAs the MIT philosopher Kieran Setiya expands in his modern interpretation of the Ethics, if your life consists only of actions whose \"worth depends on the existence of problems, difficulties, needs, which these activities aim to solve,\" you're vulnerable to the existential despair that blooms in response to the inevitable question, Is this all there is to life? One solution to this despair, he notes, is to follow Aristotle's lead and embrace pursuits that provide you a \"source of inward joy.\"\nIn this chapter, I call these joyful activities [[High-quality leisure|high-quality leisure]]. The reason that I'm reminding you here of their importance to a well-crafted life-an idea that dates back over two thousand years is that I've become convinced that to successfully tame the problems of our modern digital world, you must both understand and deploy the core insights of this ancient wisdom.

But we then find ourselves, several hours of idle watching and screen tapping later, somehow more fatigued than when we began. As Bennett would tell you-and Pete, Liz, and Teddy would confirm-if you instead rouse the motivation to spend that same time actually doing something-even if it's hard-you'll likely end the night feeling better.\nPulling together these different strands, we identify our first lesson about cultivating high-quality leisure.\nLeisure Lesson #1: Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption.  (Page 176) ^rw490188711\n\n---\nTo do so, however, we cannot passively allow the wild tangle of tools, entertainments, and distractions provided by the internet age to dictate how we spend our time or how we feel.\nWe must instead take steps to extract the good from these technologies while sidestepping what's bad. We require a philosophy that puts our aspirations and values once again in charge of our daily experience, all the while dethroning primal whims and the business models of Silicon Valley from their current dominance of this role; a philosophy that accepts new technologies, but not if the price is the dehumanization Andrew Sullivan warned us about; a philosophy that prioritizes long-term meaning over short-term satisfaction.  ^rw490185737\n\n---\nBefore outlining their case, however, the authors start with what is arguably one of their most valuable contributions, a precise definition of solitude. Many people mistakenly associate this term with physical separation-requiring, perhaps, that you hike to a remote cabin miles from another human being. This flawed definition introduces a standard of isolation that can be impractical for most to satisfy on any sort of a regular basis. As Kethledge and Erwin explain, however, solitude is about what's happening in your brain, not the environment around you. Accordingly, they define it to be a subjective state in which your mind is free from input from other minds.  ^rw490186112\n\n---\n"},{"title":"Dune","path":"Resources/Readwise/Books/Dune.md","text_content":"📚\n> [!info] Metadata\n> Author: [[Frank Herbert]]\n> Category: #books\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2B-pjts02L._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Highlights\n“I must not fear.

During the last ice age, the average temperature was just 6 degrees Celsius lower than it is today. During the age of the dinosaurs, when the average temperature was perhaps 4 degrees Celsius higher than today, there were crocodiles living above the Arctic Circle.  ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=443))\n\n---\nTo keep things simple, most people combine all the different greenhouse gases into a single measure known as “carbon dioxide equivalents.” (You might see the term abbreviated as CO2e.) We use carbon dioxide equivalents to account for the fact that some gases trap more heat than carbon dioxide but don’t stay around as long. Unfortunately, carbon dioxide equivalents are an imperfect measure: Ultimately, what really matters isn’t the amount of greenhouse gas emissions; what matters is the higher temperatures and their impact on humans. And on that front, a gas like methane is much worse than carbon dioxide. It drives the temperature up immediately, and by quite a bit. When you use carbon dioxide equivalents, you aren’t fully accounting for this important short-term effect.  ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=458))\n\n---\nBut not all radiation is on the right wavelengths to cause this effect. Sunlight, for example, passes right through most greenhouse gases without getting absorbed. Most of it reaches the earth and warms up the planet, just as it has been doing for eons. Here’s the problem: The earth doesn’t hold on to all that energy forever; if it did, the planet would already be unbearably hot. Instead, it radiates some of the energy back toward space, and some of this energy is emitted in just the right range of wavelengths to get absorbed by greenhouse gases. Rather than going out harmlessly into the void, it hits the greenhouse molecules and makes them vibrate faster, heating up the atmosphere. (By the way, we should be thankful for the greenhouse effect; without it, the planet would be far too cold for us. The problem is that all these extra greenhouse gases are sending the effect into overdrive.)

([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=655))\n\n---\nWhat’s more, the energy transition we need now is being driven by something that has never mattered before. In the past, we’ve moved from one source to another because the new one was cheaper and more powerful. When we stopped burning so much wood and started using more coal, for example, it was because we could get a lot more heat and light from a pound of coal than from a pound of wood. Or take a more recent example in the United States: We’re using more natural gas and less coal to generate electricity. Why? Because new drilling techniques made it much cheaper. It was a matter of economics, not the environment.

To do it, we need lots of breakthroughs in science and engineering. We need to build a consensus that doesn’t exist and create public policies to push a transition that would not happen otherwise. We need the energy system to stop doing all the things we don’t like and keep doing all the things we do like—in other words, to change completely and also stay the same.

With clean electricity, we could shift away from burning hydrocarbons (which emits carbon dioxide) for fuel.

When you cover land with water, if there’s a lot of carbon in the soil, the carbon eventually turns into methane and escapes into the atmosphere—which is why studies show that depending on where it’s built, a dam can actually be a worse emitter than coal for 50 to 100 years before it makes up for all the methane it’s responsible for.fn2, 3 In addition, the amount of electricity you can generate from a dam depends on the season, because you’re relying on rain-fed streams and rivers. And, of course, hydropower is immobile.  ([Location 1084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1084))\n\n---\nHow much is the premium? Changing America’s entire electricity system to zero-carbon sources would raise average retail rates by between 1.3 and 1.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, roughly 15 percent more than what most people pay now. That adds up to a Green Premium of $18 a month for the average home—pretty affordable for most people, though possibly not for low-income Americans, who already spend a tenth of their income on energy.  ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1127))\n\n---\nUnfortunately, nighttime intermittency isn’t the hardest problem to deal with. The seasonal variation between summer and winter is an even bigger hurdle. There are various ways to try to deal with it—like adding in power from a nuclear plant or a gas-fired electric plant fitted with a device that captures its emissions—and any realistic scenario will include these options. I’ll get to them later in the chapter, but for the sake of simplicity for now I’ll just use batteries to illustrate the problem of seasonal variation.  ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1182))\n\n---\nAnd we’re going to need much more clean electricity in the coming years. Most experts agree that as we electrify other carbon-intensive processes like making steel and running cars, the world’s electricity supply will need to double or even triple by 2050. And that doesn’t even account for population growth, or the fact that people will get richer and use more electricity. So the world will need much more than three times the electricity we generate now.  ([Location 1228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1228))\n\n---\nHere’s another complication: As our houses rely less on fossil fuels and more on electricity (for example, to power electric cars and stay warm in the winter), we’ll need to upgrade the electrical service to each household—by at least a factor of two, and in many cases even more than that. A lot of streets will need to be dug up and electrical poles climbed to install heavier wires, transformers, and other equipment. So it will be felt in a real way by nearly every community, and the political impact will get down to the local level.  ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1280))\n\n---\nNuclear fission. Here’s the one-sentence case for nuclear power: It’s the only carbon-free energy source that can reliably deliver power day and night, through every season, almost anywhere on earth, that has been proven to work on a large scale.  ([Location 1302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1302))\n\n---\nPumped hydro. This is a method of storing city-sized amounts of energy, and it works like this: When electricity is cheap (for example, when a stiff wind is turning your turbines really fast), you pump water up a hill into a reservoir; then, when demand for power goes up, you let the water flow back down the hill, using it to spin a turbine and generate more electricity. Pumped hydro is the biggest form of grid-scale electricity storage in the world. Unfortunately, that’s not saying much. The 10 largest facilities in the United States can store less than an hour’s worth of the country’s electricity consumption. You can probably guess why it hasn’t really taken off: To pump water up a hill, you need a big reservoir of water and, of course, a hill. Without either, you’re out of luck.  ([Location 1417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1417))\n\n---\nPlastics are also what allow fuel-efficient cars to be so light; they account for as much as half of a car’s total volume, but only 10 percent of its weight.  ([Location 1530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1530))\n\n---\nGiven the presence of carbon and oxygen, you can probably see where this is going. After burning the limestone, you end up with the thing you want—calcium for your cement—plus something you don’t want: carbon dioxide. Nobody knows of a way to make cement without going through this process. It’s a chemical reaction—limestone plus heat equals calcium oxide plus carbon dioxide—and there’s no way around it. It’s a one-to-one relationship. Make a ton of cement, and you’ll get a ton of carbon dioxide.  ([Location 1575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1575))\n\n---\nThat’s a major environmental problem, because the plastics that get dumped in landfills and oceans stick around for a century or more. And it’s a problem that’s worth solving: Pieces of plastic floating around in the ocean cause all sorts of problems, including poisoning marine life. But they’re not making climate change worse. Purely in terms of emissions, the carbon in plastics is not such bad news. Because plastics take so long to degrade, all the carbon atoms that go into them are atoms that won’t go into the atmosphere and drive up the temperature—at least not for a very long time.  ([Location 1597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1597))\n\n---\nThen there’s the second stage: How can we generate heat without burning fossil fuels? If you don’t need super-high temperatures, you can use electric heat pumps and other technologies. But when you’re looking for temperatures in the thousands of degrees, electricity isn’t an economical option—at least not with today’s technology. You’ll have to either use nuclear power or burn fossil fuels and grab the emissions with carbon-capture devices. Unfortunately, carbon capture doesn’t come for free. It adds to the manufacturer’s cost and gets passed on to the consumer.  ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1613))\n\n---\nClean electricity would help us solve another problem too: making plastics. If enough pieces come together, plastics could one day become a carbon sink—a way to remove carbon rather than emit it.  ([Location 1662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1662))\n\n---\nTo sum up, the path to zero emissions in manufacturing looks like this: Electrify every process possible. This is going to take a lot of innovation. Get that electricity from a power grid that’s been decarbonized. This also will take a lot of innovation. Use carbon capture to absorb the remaining emissions. And so will this. Use materials more efficiently. Same. Get used to this theme. You’ll see it often in the coming chapters.  ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1677))\n\n---\nAs a result, even though the global population is growing, there are not hundreds of millions of people starving to death in India or anywhere else. In fact, food is becoming more affordable, not less. In the United States, the average household spends less of its budget today on food than it did 30 years ago, a trend that’s being repeated in other parts of the world as well.  ([Location 1717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1717))\n\n---\nAs Borlaug’s semi-dwarf wheat spread around the world, and as other breeders did similar work on corn and rice, yields tripled in most areas. Starvation plummeted, and today Borlaug is widely credited with saving a billion lives. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970, and we’re still feeling the impact of his work: Virtually all the wheat grown on earth is descended from the plants he bred. (One downside of these new varieties is that they need lots of fertilizer to reach their full growth potential, and as we’ll discuss in a later section, fertilizer has some negative side effects.)  ([Location 1727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1727))\n\n---\nAnother concern: If we make a big push to generate energy from plants, we could accidentally spark a competition for cropland. As I’ll describe in chapter 7, advanced biofuels made from things like switchgrass could give us zero-carbon ways to power trucks, ships, and airplanes. But if we grow those crops on land that would otherwise be used to feed a growing population, we could inadvertently drive up food prices, pushing even more people into poverty and malnutrition while accelerating the already dangerous pace of deforestation.  ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1747))\n\n---\nThere’s a huge gap in agriculture. Thanks to fertilizer and other improvements, American farmers now get more corn per unit of land than ever. But African farmers’ yields have barely budged. Narrowing the gap will save lives and help people escape poverty, but without innovation it will also make climate change worse. (FAO)10  ([Location 1844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1844))\n\n---\nAll told, fertilizers were responsible for roughly 1.3 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2010, and the number will probably rise to 1.7 billion tons by mid-century. Haber-Bosch giveth, and Haber-Bosch taketh away.  ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1867))\n\n---\nThere’s the immediate and obvious impact of deforestation—if the trees are burned down, for example, they quickly release all the carbon dioxide they contain—but it also causes damage that’s harder to see. When you take a tree out of the ground, you disturb the soil, and it turns out that there’s a lot of carbon stored up in soil (in fact, there’s more carbon in soil than in the atmosphere and all plant life combined). When you start removing trees, that stored carbon gets released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.  ([Location 1890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1890))\n\n---\nWas anything else growing in that spot? If, for example, you eliminate a soybean farm and replace it with a forest, you’ve reduced the total amount of soybeans available, which will drive up their price, making it more likely that someone will cut down trees somewhere else to grow soybeans. This will offset at least some of the good you do by planting your trees.  ([Location 1926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=1926))\n\n---\nSo to electrify America’s fleet of trucks, freight companies would have to shift to vehicles that carry less cargo, stop to recharge far more often, spend hours of time recharging, and somehow travel long stretches of highway where there are no recharging stations. It’s just not going to happen anytime soon. Although electricity is a good option when you need to cover short distances, it’s not a practical solution for heavy, long-haul trucks.  ([Location 2102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=2102))\n\n---\nMaking the switch to alternatives would do us a lot of good; because shipping alone accounts for 3 percent of all emissions, using clean fuels would give us a meaningful reduction. Unfortunately, the fuel that container ships run on—it’s called bunker fuel—is dirt cheap, because it’s made from the dregs of the oil-refining process. Since their current fuel is so inexpensive, the Green Premium for ships is very high:  ([Location 2129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=2129))\n\n---\nI spend a lot of time with people who oversee the foreign aid budgets in rich-world countries. Even some very well-intentioned ones have told me, “We used to fund vaccines. Now we need to make our aid budget climate-sensitive”—by which they mean helping Africa lower its greenhouse gas emissions. I tell them, “Please don’t take away vaccine money and put it into electric cars. Africa is responsible for only about 2 percent of all global emissions. What you really should be funding there is adaptation. The best way we can help the poor adapt to climate change is to make sure they’re healthy enough to survive it. And to thrive despite it.”  ([Location 2405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=2405))\n\n---\nBroadly speaking, you can think of adaptation in three stages. The first involves reducing the risks posed by climate change, through steps like climate-proofing buildings and other infrastructure, protecting wetlands as a bulwark against flooding, and—when necessary—encouraging people to relocate permanently from areas that are no longer livable. Next is preparing for and responding to emergencies. We need to keep improving weather forecasts and early-warning systems for getting out information about storms. And when disaster does strike, we need well-equipped and well-trained teams of first responders and a system in place for handling temporary evacuations. Finally, after a disaster, there’s the recovery period. We’ll need to plan for services for people who’ve been displaced—services like health care and education—as well as insurance that helps people at all income levels rebuild and standards to ensure that whatever gets rebuilt is more climate-proof than what was there before.  ([Location 2474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=2474))\n\n---\nIn addition to technology and policy, there’s a third aspect that we’ll need to factor in: the companies that will develop new inventions and make sure they reach a global scale, as well as the investors and financial markets that will back these companies. For lack of a better term, I’ll broadly call this group “markets.” Markets, technology, and policy are like three levers that we need to pull in order to wean ourselves from fossil fuels. We need to pull all three of them at the same time and in the same direction.  ([Location 2731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=2731))\n\n---\nTo be clear: The point of these stories is not that solar and wind are the answer to all our electricity needs. (They are two of the answers to some of our electricity needs. See chapter 4.) The point is that when we focus on all three things at once—technology, policies, and markets—we can encourage innovation, spark new companies, and get new products into the market fast.  ([Location 2799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=2799))\n\n---\nDirect public investment in research and development is one of the most important things we can do to fight climate change, but governments aren’t doing nearly enough of it. In total, government funding for clean energy R&D amounts to about $22 billion per year, only around 0.02 percent of the global economy. Americans spend more than that on gasoline in a single month.  ([Location 2883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=2883))\n\n---\nUse procurement power. Governments at all levels—national, state, and local—buy enormous amounts of fuel, cement, and steel. They build and operate planes and trucks and cars, and they consume gigawatts’ worth of electricity. This puts them in the perfect position to drive emerging technologies into the market at relatively low cost—especially if you factor in the social benefits of bringing these technologies to scale. Defense departments can commit to buying some low-carbon liquid fuels for planes and ships. State governments can use low-emissions cement and steel in construction projects. Utilities can invest in long-duration storage.  ([Location 2936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=2936))\n\n---\nLuckily, as I mentioned in chapter 10, we’re no strangers to scaling up energy technologies. We drove rural electrification and expanded the domestic production of fossil fuels by tying policy and innovation together. You might consider some of those policies—like various tax advantages for oil companies—subsidies for fossil fuels, but they’re really just a tool for deploying a technology we thought was valuable. Remember that until the late 1970s—when the concept of climate change first entered the national debate—it was widely accepted that the best way to raise the quality of life and spread economic development was to expand the use of fossil fuels. Now we can take the lessons we learned from the purposeful growth of fossil fuels and apply them to clean energy.  ([Location 2967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=2967))\n\n---\nStates can play a crucial role in demonstrating innovative technologies and policies, such as using their utilities and road construction projects to drive technologies like long-duration storage and low-emissions cement into the market.  ([Location 3063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=3063))\n\n---\ncreating jobs and reducing emissions at the same time. Think about all the good that comes from medical research funded by the National Institutes of Health. The NIH publishes its results so scientists around the world can benefit from the work, but its funding also builds up capacity in American universities that are, in turn, connected to both start-ups and big companies. The result: an American export—advanced medical expertise—that creates a lot of high-paying jobs at home and saves lives around the world. It’s a similar story in technology, where early investments by the Department of Defense led to the creation of the internet and the microchips that powered the personal computer revolution. And the same thing can happen in clean energy. There are markets worth billions of dollars waiting for someone to invent low-cost, zero-carbon cement or steel, or a net-zero liquid fuel. As I’ve tried to show, making these breakthroughs and getting them to scale will be hard, but the opportunities are so big that it’s worth getting out in front of the rest of the world.  ([Location 3119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YTNGRCY&location=3119))\n\n---\nSecond, we need to let science—actually, many different sciences—guide our efforts. In the case of COVID-19, we are looking to biology, virology, and pharmacology, as well as political science and economics—after all, deciding how to distribute vaccines equitably is an inherently political act. And just as epidemiology tells us about the risks of COVID-19 but not how to stop it, climate science tells us why we need to change course but not how to do it. For that, we must draw on engineering, physics, environmental science, economics, and more.

Railings don’t offer much protection for a cat who can slip underneath or through the bars. All it takes is for your cat to get distracted by one bird or flying insect, and a tragedy could result. Don’t mistakenly believe that supervision will keep her safe. Should a passing bird entice your cat, her instinct to leap after her prey will cause her to go over the railing long before you can grab her. If you’re still under the assumption that cats always land on their feet, refer back to the section on windows.  (Location 995)\n\n---\nBecome familiar with your cat’s normal routine. Notice how much water he usually drinks. This will be important information because an increase or decrease in water consumption can be a symptom of certain diseases.  (Location 1424)\n\n---\nAnimals are very smart. They don’t repeat behaviors unless they serve a purpose. Even though you may not understand or like the behavior doesn’t mean it isn’t serving a necessary purpose for the animal. So the key to your think like a cat approach is to: 1. Figure out what purpose the behavior serves. What’s the “payoff” for the cat? 2. Offer an alternative behavior that is of equal or increased value. 3. Reward the cat for choosing the alternative. Where owners get tripped up is in assuming the cat’s behavior is motivated by anger, spite, or stupidity.  (Location 1718)\n\n---\nYou may be wondering why you’d need to teach your cat to roll over or give you a high five. Your cat doesn’t actually need to know those specific behaviors but by working on at least a couple with your cat you both develop the skill of clicker training. Your cat starts learning in a positive, rewarding way. Good behavior has good consequences. Unwanted behavior doesn’t have good consequences. Your cat is smart—she’ll start focusing on the behaviors that have the good consequences. Clicker training also helps the cat feel as if she has more control over her environment, which can help relax her so she’ll be less inclined to exhibit negative behaviors.  (Location 1764)\n\n---\nTeaching Your Cat to Respond to His Name This is actually a very important behavior to teach. When you need to locate your cat before you leave the house or you need to get your cat away from something dangerous, being able to depend on her to come when called can be a lifesaver.  (Location 1776)\n\n---\nThe proper way to pick up a cat is by putting one hand on her chest, just behind her front legs, and use the other hand to cradle her hindquarters and hind legs. Bring her in close to you so that she can lean against your chest. Her front paws can rest on your forearm. This method allows her to feel supported, yet not trapped. This method of holding is for when you have her in a safe location such as inside your home.  (Location 1817)\n\n---\nWhen you put your cat down, do so gently. Don’t let her leap out of your arms. You don’t want to train her that the only way she can get out of your grasp is to struggle and jump for her life. Let her down before she struggles and she won’t associate being held with confinement.  (Location 1820)\n\n---\nA common behavior problem that develops in single-owner homes is that the cat becomes so used to the sound, touch, and movements of one person, that when just one guest comes over, the cat panics. Imagine the cat’s terror should the owner get married (especially if children and other pets are part of the package). Early, gentle exposure to a variety of situations will help your kitten grow up well-adjusted rather than a cat nobody ever sees or worse, the kind your friends label as “the attack cat.”  (Location 1923)\n\n---\nMany people assume the outdoor cat who “plays” with his prey after injuring or killing it, is being cruel. In reality, though, the behavior is most likely a displacement due to the excitement and anxiety of the hunt. During the hunt the cat must deal with the fear of getting injured himself in the process.  (Location 2036)\n\n---\nThere are many interactive toys on the market. Some are pretty basic and others are very elaborate. When shopping for one, again, use your think like a cat approach. Look at the toy and imagine what kind of prey it resembles and how your cat, based on her personality, would react to it. Because cats are opportunistic hunters, which means they hunt whatever is available, look for several different types of interactive toys. Try to cover the various types of prey such as: birds, mice, insects, and snakes. Your cat will be more interested if you vary the toys, because she’ll never know just which prey to expect.  (Location 2057)\n\n---\nCats don’t chase to exhaustion, they silently stalk and ambush when they’ve gotten close enough. In the wild, a cat uses every rock, tree, and bush for cover as she inches closer to her prey (that’s where your sofa, chairs, table, and cushions come in). Therefore, much of her efficient hunting technique involves her patience, planning, and precision. Your cat has incredible stealth and she wants to make good use of that during playtime. Play with your cat in a way that’s natural and satisfying to her.  (Location 2109)\n\n---\nTry to emmulate the natural intensity curve of a real hunt. For example, when you work out you have a warm-up, the actual exercise, and the cool-down. Your playtime should provide this as well. Don’t play like crazy with your cat, ripping around having a grand time, and then, discovering it’s time to leave for work, suddenly ending the game.  (Location 2121)\n\n---\nUnless you’re using specific play sessions to work out behavior problems (see section later in this chapter), I’d recommend that the first session be in the morning before you leave for work, because after you go, your kitty will be sleeping on and off for the entire day. The second session should then be in the evening. A third session right before bedtime will help a cat who tends to keep you up at night with her after-dark activities.  (Location 2151)\n\n---\nVery often cats will eat catnip (it’s safe), but the pleasureinducing effect is actually only achieved by smelling the herb. The effects, which last about fifteen minutes, are completely harmless and nonaddictive, and after those fifteen minutes of ecstasy and zany fun, cats are relaxed and ready for a nap.  (Location 2236)\n\n---\nHere’s what many owners don’t know about catnip: if you leave catnip or catnip-filled toys out for your cat all of the time, she can become immune to its effects. I explain that to my clients whenever I enter their homes and see dozens of catnip-filled toys. How sad for the kitties that their owners may be ruining this feline pleasure without knowing it. Limit catnip to once or twice a week. You can always add an extra session now and then if needed, for instance, after a visit to the veterinarian or other stressful event.  (Location 2241)\n\n---\nRibbons, strings, yarn, rubber bands, and dental floss may seem like fun things for cats to play with, but they’re extremely dangerous if swallowed. With all of the safe toys available, don’t take a chance with any of these.  (Location 2328)\n\n---\nWhen you place his food bowl on the floor, if you notice that he’s constantly looking around, frequently stopping to check out his surroundings, then you should move his feeding station to an area that is more secure for him. Try feeding him on top of a cat tree or in a quieter room.  (Location 2500)\n\n---\nOther cats may become vocal for many reasons. Mostly, it’s a surefire way of getting your attention. When the less subtle method of staring you down, walking back and forth in front of your computer monitor, or sitting on your chest doesn’t do the trick, nonstop meows usually work.  (Location 2525)\n\n---\nSurvival is the motivation behind the ritual of burying waste. A cat’s urine is very concentrated and has a strong odor that can be detected by predators in the wild. Cats in the wild urinate and defecate away from their nest and cover their waste so they don’t attract predators back to their young. For safety, cats don’t eliminate where they eat, sleep, play, or raise young. Your indoor cat has those same instincts.  (Location 3088)\n\n---\nIn a multicat household, more than one box will be needed. This is not just because one box gets dirty too quickly (although it does), but also because some cats object to sharing and one cat may be too intimidated to pass another cat in order to get to the cat’s area. The litter box rule: have the same number of boxes as you have cats.  (Location 3183)\n\n---\nIf you’ve ever seen a cat run to his post to scratch when his owner arrives home, you’ve witnessed how scratching can serve as an emotional outlet as well. A cat will also use scratching to displace the frustration he may feel after being reprimanded or being unable to do something that he wants to do (for example, capturing the bird he sees through the window).  (Location 3731)\n\n---\nSo what’s wrong with the average post? Let’s start with the cover material. Most posts are covered with carpet that’s too soft and plush. A cat needs a rough textured material that he can sink his nails into to help discard the dead sheaths. If you have a cat who is scratching on furniture instead of the post, compare the two textures. Run your hand along the post and then along the furniture. The furniture wins.  (Location 3765)\n\n---\nDo you think those things really matter to a cat? If your kitty took over the duties of chef at your house, you’d be sitting down to a plate of one small mouse with a side dish of butterflies and grasshoppers. Tomorrow’s menu would probably include Bird a la Felix, seasoned to perfection with a hint of catnip.  (Location 3994)\n\n---\nFor a cat with no health issues, feed a variety of foods so you don’t end up with a finicky eater. Vary the diet with different flavors. You may also want to alternate between a couple of manufacturers. If you vary the diet from the beginning, you’re more likely to raise a cat who won’t become addicted to one kind of food. When you first begin alternating, mix in the new food with the old gradually. This way, you’ll avoid rejection of the food and potential intestinal trouble.  (Location 4092)\n\n---\nAllow leftover canned food that has been refrigerated to come to room temperature before serving it to your kitty. Not only could the chilled food upset his stomach, but a lump of cold, dayold food stands a good chance of feline rejection. Always keep food tightly covered when storing. Once opened, a can of food should be used within a couple of days.  (Location 4116)\n\n---\nWhen feeding standard cat food, vary flavors and brands to keep from developing a finicky eater.  (Location 4176)\n\n---\nThe tuna meant for humans, though, is not a good food for your cat. Tuna is high in polyunsaturated fats that cats don’t metabolize well. A steady diet of tuna depletes the body of vitamin E and can lead to a very painful condition called steatitis. Tuna-flavored cat foods are supplemented with extra vitamin E to prevent this, but straight tuna is not.  (Location 4273)\n\n---\nPut one hand on either side of him. By firmly stroking his sides, you should be able to feel his ribs (if you can actually see his ribs, then he’s underweight). If you can’t feel his ribs without applying very firm pressure then he’s overweight.

In outdoor life, it’s not unusual for female cats to nurse and care for each others’ kittens. Cats are routinely referred to as solitary creatures but that misconception probably comes from the fact that cats tend to hunt alone because of the size of the prey they go after.  (Location 4434)\n\n---\nGrooming is also used as a displacement behavior. When a cat wants to do something and is prevented from it, he often will groom himself to relieve his anxiety. You may notice this when your cat watches the birds outside. He can’t get to them and needs to do something with his energy.  (Location 4851)\n\n---\nOne thing that disturbs me when it comes to how some people help their children through this process is when they immediately get a “replacement” pet. Instead of teaching children that pets are disposable and easily replaceable, we should be helping them through this difficult time without trivializing the value of an animal’s life.

So if you place a bottle of each into its cage, it will drink about the same amount from each. However, in a groundbreaking study published in 1988, Sclafani’s team showed that when they infused partially digested starch directly into the rats’ stomachs while they drank cherry-flavored water, the rats developed a preference for that flavor over the grape flavor.35 And the opposite preference developed when they repeated it with the grape flavor. Even though the starch never entered their mouths, after four days, the rats displayed a near-total preference for the starch-paired flavor.  (Location 687)\n\n---\nFurther experiments showed that the rats weren’t detecting the starch itself but the sugar glucose that’s released as starch is broken up in the digestive tract. And the critical location for detection was the upper small intestine. Somehow, the intestine was sensing the glucose and sending a signal to the brain that said, “Something good just happened. Do that again!”  (Location 698)\n\n---\ncarbohydrate, particularly in childhood. When you examine this list, you’ll find it apparent that the human brain is extremely preoccupied with calories. Other than  (Location 765)\n\n---\nWhen you examine this list, you’ll find it apparent that the human brain is extremely preoccupied with calories. Other than salt, every innate preference is a signal that indicates a concentrated calorie source. This is presumably because calorie shortage was a key threat to our ancestors’ reproductive success, so we’ve been wired by evolution to value high-calorie foods above all others. Consistent with this, modern-day hunter-gatherers living in a manner similar to how our distant ancestors would have lived don’t spend much time or effort gathering wild brussels sprouts. They primarily spend their time looking for calorie-rich foods that can sustain their energy needs, like nuts, meats, tubers, honey, and fruit—a topic we’ll return to later.  (Location 766)\n\n---\nHigh concentrations of sugar, refined carbohydrates (bread, white rice, pasta made with white flour), fats (butter, lard, margarine), salt, and caffeine are addictive substances and the foods containing these ingredients may be consumed in a manner consistent with addictive behavior. Just like drugs of abuse, these food substances may not be addictive until they are processed, extracted, highly refined and concentrated by modern industrial processes; meanwhile, combinations of these look-like-food substances may greatly enhance their addictive qualities.  (Location 810)\n\n---\nWhat makes this alarming is that modern food technology has allowed us to maximize the reinforcing qualities of food, making it far more seductive than ever before in human history. We now have extremely calorie-dense, carefully engineered combinations of sugar, fat, salt, and starch that would have been inconceivable to our hunter-gatherer ancestors, who had no choice but to eat simple wild foods. Certain modern foods likely provoke a larger release of dopamine than the human brain evolved to expect, leading to destructive addiction-like behaviors in susceptible people. (Yet not everyone is susceptible—a topic we’ll return to shortly.)  (Location 817)\n\n---\nTheobromine is a mild stimulant that’s moderately reinforcing, like its cousin caffeine.48 Although theobromine on its own may not be the bee’s knees, when added to a substance that’s already highly reinforcing, it puts many of us over the edge. It may come as no surprise that chocolate addiction is a legitimate topic of scientific research. Even those of us who aren’t “chocoholics” may experience chocolate cravings, and research indicates that chocolate is the most frequently craved food among women.  (Location 834)\n\n---\nThe fact that sensory-specific satiety drives us to overeat suggests a simple solution to the problem: Limit yourself to a few foods. If you find yourself at a buffet, tapas restaurant, or similar situation in which high food variety may cause you to overeat, simply choose three items you think would make a satisfying meal, and stick to them. You’ll probably feel just as full on fewer calories.  (Location 937)\n\n---\nSensory-specific satiety also helps explain why we’re happy to eat dessert even after a large meal. We’re no longer hungry for savory food at all, yet when the dessert menu appears, we suddenly grow a “second stomach.” We’re satiated of savory foods, but we aren’t satiated of sweets. A novel sensory stimulus with an extremely high reward value makes it easy to pack away an additional 200 Calories of dessert.  (Location 945)\n\n---\nThese studies have produced very provocative results: first, that sweet foods are exceptionally motivating, especially to youths. “If you let teenagers work for sweet soda,” relates Epstein, “they will work really hard … People will make thousands of responses for a small piece of candy.” A second provocative conclusion is that people who are overweight or obese tend to have a higher RRVfood than people who are lean. In particular, children who are overweight or obese are much more willing to work for highly rewarding foods like pizza or candy than lean children, even if their baseline level of hunger is the same.  (Location 989)\n\n---\npredict who would go on to gain weight and who wouldn’t. Their results were remarkably consistent: RRVfood not only predicts weight gain in children, but in every age group they examined. In one study, adults with a high RRVfood gained more than five pounds over the course of a year, whereas adults with a low RRVfood only gained half a pound. “If you look at a group of lean people and you measure the reinforcing value of food,” explains Epstein, “you can predict who will gain weight.” These findings suggest that people differ in their motivation to eat food, particularly highly rewarding foods, and that this is a stable personality trait that influences each person’s susceptibility to weight gain over time. This offers a partial answer to the question posed earlier: Heightened food reward sensitivity does seem to contribute to overeating and fat gain over time.  (Location 1001)\n\n---\nAs Epstein puts it, “If you find something really rewarding and you have really poor impulse control, you’re in a lot of trouble.” Epstein coined the term reinforcement pathology to describe the dangerous combination of high reinforcement sensitivity and high impulsivity. He explains that it’s like having a “lead foot and worn brakes.” This may identify why some people are more susceptible to food addiction than others, despite the fact that we’re all exposed to potentially addictive foods.  (Location 1018)\n\n---\nThe deadliest combination, therefore, occurs when an impulsive person with a high food reward sensitivity lives in an environment that’s bursting at the seams with highly rewarding foods.57 And as we will soon see, the United States qualifies as such an environment.  (Location 1034)\n\n---\nFirst, they include a limited variety of foods. For example, although the!Kung San recognized at least 105 plants as edible, only 14 formed the bulk of their plant food intake, and only a subset of these 14 plant foods was available at any given season and location. Throughout the year, half of their calorie intake came from a single food, the mongongo fruit/nut. Over the course of the entire year, the!Kung San diet was quite varied; yet over the course of a day, it may have focused on only a few foods. Because of the seasonal availability of key resources, the same is true of most other nonindustrial cultures.  (Location 1104)\n\n---\nSecond, they have a limited ability to concentrate the reinforcing properties of food. With only the most basic processing methods at their disposal, nonindustrial cultures—and presumably our distant ancestors—are forced by necessity to eat food in a less calorie-dense, less refined, less rewarding state. Most don’t have the ability to add refined starch, sugar, salt, or concentrated fat to their meals.  (Location 1108)\n\n---\nIn sharp contrast to the dietary habits of nonindustrial cultures, which are limited by availability, affluent industrial cultures are steeped in a vast abundance of food choices, most of which are professionally crafted to maximize reward value. This variety means we experience less sensory-specific satiety, almost like a perpetual buffet.  (Location 1127)\n\n---\nIt’s clear that our food culture has changed profoundly in this country over the last century, a period over which we’ve outsourced the majority of our food preparation to professionals. This shift toward outsourced food preparation on an industrial scale has led to remarkable changes in the processing and composition of the food we eat.  (Location 1136)\n\n---\nThe 1970s brought one of the most significant technological advances in US diet history: high-fructose corn syrup. This is a sweetener produced from corn starch that has approximately the same sweetness as cane sugar. Thanks to government-subsidized corn, it’s so cheap that food manufacturers can use it to beef up the reward value of their foods at virtually no cost, tickling the brain circuits that make us reach for the cookies.  (Location 1154)\n\n---\nRather than getting our fat from whole foods like meat, dairy, and nuts, we now get it primarily from oils that are mechanically and chemically extracted from seeds. These liquid oils are cheap and convenient to add to foods that would otherwise contain little fat, creating such food reward masterpieces as french fries and Doritos. Added fat increases the calorie content of food and our drive to eat it, ultimately causing us to overeat.  (Location 1172)\n\n---\nIn popular media, there is a perennial debate over whether sugar or fat is responsible for the obesity epidemic. This has led some people to view obesity research as a team sport rather than a scientific discipline. Allow me to end the debate by stating what most researchers find quite obvious: It’s both. In particular, the combination of concentrated sugar and fat in the same food is a deadly one for our food reward system. It’s also a pairing that rarely occurs in nature, so it’s tempting to speculate that it’s more than our brains are equipped to handle constructively. Think ice cream, chocolate, cookies, and cake—foods we crave, and foods we don’t need to be hungry to eat. What would they be without sugar, and what would they be without fat?  (Location 1189)\n\n---\nModern food technology gives us an exquisite degree of control over the rewarding properties of food, and it offers us tremendous food variety. As food technology has advanced, affluent diets have gradually evolved to mirror the innate food preferences of the human brain. While these preferences kept us alive and well in an ancestral environment, they cause us to overeat in an environment that satisfies them to an unprecedented degree.  (Location 1223)\n\n---\nYet despite the fact that they guzzle sugar and fat when available, neither the Hadza nor the Aché have obesity. In fact, the Hadza have an ideal body composition by modern Western standards: men average 11 percent body fat, women average 20 percent, and neither gender becomes fatter with age. The only Hadza with obesity Wood has ever encountered was a rich man who didn’t maintain a traditional diet or lifestyle. While Aché hunter-gatherers can have somewhat higher adiposity, especially young women, they rarely have obesity. How can they engage in such gluttonous behavior and yet remain lean? The energy balance equation we encountered in chapter 1 allows only one possible answer: Their long-term average energy intake must match their energy expenditure.74 The reality of hunter-gatherer life is that true starvation is rare, yet they often don’t get as many calories as they would like. Despite appearing healthy and well fed, both Aché and Hadza adults frequently report feeling hungry.  (Location 1418)\n\n---\nThis leads us to a key conclusion about life as a hunter-gatherer: Gluttony is good for them. Eating as much sugar, fat, protein, and starch as possible, whenever it’s available, increases their ability to thrive and bear children in a wild environment. “When those opportunities do present themselves,” argues Wood, “there’s basically no downside to going for it. It’s all upside.” Unlike in the modern affluent world, in which overeating is a major cause of ill health, in a hunter-gather environment, overeating is healthy. The same would probably have been true of our own ancestors until relatively recently in human history.77  (Location 1437)\n\n---\nFor most of our history, our instinctive drives to seek large amounts of fat, sugar, starch, and protein were well aligned with our interests. There was no need to count calories or to feel guilty about eating too much. Yet in today’s world of extreme food abundance, these same drives often undermine our health and even our ability to reproduce. We try to use the sophisticated tools of our cognitive mind to restrain our impulses to overeat, yet the impulses often win. The brain that drives hunter-gatherers to gorge on calorie-dense foods—because it’s good for them—is the same brain that drives us to overeat in the modern world.  (Location 1443)\n\n---\nThe practical implications for avoiding overeating are clear: Don’t make it too easy for yourself to eat food throughout the day. Even effort barriers as small as having to open a cabinet, twist off a lid, peel an orange, or shell nuts can make the difference between eating the right amount and overeating. Keeping easy, tempting foods in plain sight, such as an open bag of chips or bowl of candy, creates a situation that is simply too tempting for the parts of our brains that are constantly on the lookout for a good deal.  (Location 1471)\n\n---\nMultiple studies have confirmed that people who steeply discount the value of future rewards are more likely to have obesity. They’re also more likely to be addicted to illegal drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes; more likely to gamble; and more likely to carry credit card debt.86 In essence, these are all examples of pursuing immediate rewards without much regard for future consequences.  (Location 1629)\n\n---\nIs there anything we can do to fight our natural tendency to shortchange our future selves? Research from Leonard Epstein’s group and others suggests that the answer is yes—by giving the rational brain a little boost using an exercise called episodic future thinking. This phrase is a complex-sounding term for a technique that’s actually quite simple: Before making a decision, you imagine yourself in the future. When making a decision about something that pits your present self versus your future self, such as whether or not to eat a pastry, first imagine positive events in the future, such as your birthday or an upcoming vacation. Place yourself in the scene and imagine yourself enjoying it. The more vivid the imagery, the better. This process fires up the regions in your prefrontal cortex that process abstract concepts like the future and therefore causes your brain to intuitively weight the future more heavily in its decision-making process. This attenuates delay discounting. Epstein’s research shows that episodic future thinking reduces the intake of tempting, calorie-dense foods by nearly one-third in overweight women, and the same trick works for overweight children as well.  (Location 1639)\n\n---\nHervey proposed that fat tissue secretes a hormonal satiety factor whose blood levels reflect adiposity, such that the more fat tissue a person carries, the higher his level of the hormone. This hormone then travels through the bloodstream and acts in the satiety center of the brain to constrain appetite and adiposity (see figure 31). The idea is that when body fat levels increase, the satiety factor increases, and this suppresses appetite and reduces adiposity back to its initial level. Conversely, when body fat levels decrease, the satiety factor decreases, and this stimulates appetite and fat gain back up to its initial level. Together, Hervey hypothesized, the satiety factor and the VMN form a feedback system that regulates adiposity, working to keep it at a stable level. They named this fat-regulating system the lipostat, after the Greek words for “fat” and “stationary.”  (Location 1731)\n\n---\nGradually, researchers converged on a remarkable conclusion: Even though each obesity model had been developed independently, VMN lesions, the obese mutation, the Zucker fatty mutation, and overfeeding all appeared to impact the same fat-regulating system. Obese mice are unable to produce the satiety factor; VMN-lesioned animals and Zucker fatty rats are unable to respond to it; and overfed animals overproduce it. These independent models all supported the fundamental importance of the same fat-regulating system Hervey had hypothesized in 1959: the lipostat.  (Location 1766)\n\n---\nOne of the earliest pieces of evidence came from Rudolf Neumann, a physiology researcher in Hamburg, Germany, who from 1895 to 1897 obsessively measured his own calorie intake and body weight. Neumann found that over a three-year period, his body weight remained surprisingly stable without any conscious effort to control it, despite the fact that his calorie intake fluctuated up and down in the short term.  (Location 1784)\n\n---\nOn December 1, 1994, without Leibel’s knowledge, Friedman published the identity of the ob gene in the journal Nature. He reported that the gene codes for a small protein hormone that’s secreted by fat tissue and circulates in the blood. Friedman named this hormone leptin, after the Greek word leptos, meaning “thin.” Furthermore, he showed that humans carry an almost identical gene. The paper concludes, presciently: Identification of ob now offers an entry point into the pathways that regulate adiposity and body weight and should provide a fuller understanding of the [development] of obesity. The satiety factor had been identified. And obesity was on its way to becoming a biological problem.  (Location 1822)\n\n---\nAnd most important, the brain ramps up hunger and increases the response to food cues that signal high-calorie, high-reward foods. Before weight loss, you might have been able to stroll by the ice cream aisle without any problem, but after weight loss, the temptation to buy and eat ice cream can be overwhelming. In effect, substantial weight loss triggers a starvation response, whether a person is lean, overweight, or obese—and this response continues until the fat comes back.  (Location 1894)\n\n---\nThis disappointment forced the academic and pharmaceutical communities to confront a distressing possibility: The leptin system defends vigorously against weight loss, but not so vigorously against weight gain. “I have always thought, and continue to believe,” explains Leibel, “that the leptin hormone is really a mechanism for detecting deficiency, not excess.” It’s not designed to constrain body fatness, perhaps because being too fat is rarely a problem in the wild. Many researchers now believe that while low leptin levels in humans engage a powerful starvation response that promotes fat gain, high leptin levels don’t engage an equally powerful response that promotes fat loss.  (Location 1927)\n\n---\nLeibel and Hirsch’s findings suggest that the lipostat isn’t broken in garden-variety obesity—it simply regulates adiposity around a higher set point, analogous to turning up the thermostat in your home.104 When the adiposity set point is high, the brain requires a higher level of leptin to restrain the starvation response, and in the long run, the only way to get more leptin is to have more fat. In other words, for the brain of a person with obesity, obese is the new lean. Researchers call this phenomenon leptin resistance, because the brain seems to have a hard time “hearing” normal levels of leptin.  (Location 1959)\n\n---\nWhat are the implications for us? The first is that once a person develops obesity, it becomes a self-sustaining state, and the person has to overeat to feel the same satisfaction that a lean person feels after eating a smaller meal. In essence, once we gain weight, the lipostat becomes one of the primary reasons why we continue to overeat, undermining our conscious desire to be lean and healthy. A second key implication is that weight loss is hard because it requires us to fight deeply wired impulses. Long-term diet trials suggest that the hypothalamus is remarkably good at undermining fat-loss efforts.  (Location 1968)\n\n---\nMany researchers, including myself, speculate that the lipostat behaves abnormally because it’s been placed in an unfamiliar situation: The hypothalamus is wired to keep us healthy and fertile in an environment that disappeared long ago. In today’s environment of plentiful, tasty, refined, calorie-dense food, low physical activity requirements, and other unnatural characteristics, the lipostat essentially misfires, driving many of us inexorably to overeat and gain weight.  (Location 1997)\n\n---\nCabanac’s team had a group of volunteers eat an unrestricted bland liquid diet for three weeks, which caused them to spontaneously eat fewer calories and lose just under seven pounds. Then the researchers had a second group of volunteers lose the same amount of weight over the same period of time by deliberately restricting the portion size of their normal diet. Cabanac found that the portion control group developed the expected hunger response to weight loss—but the bland diet group didn’t. He reported that the bland diet volunteers “reduced their intake voluntarily and were always in good spirits,” while the portion control group “had to continually fight off their hunger and would spend the night dreaming of food.” On the bland diet, the starvation response never kicked in. Cabanac concluded that diet palatability influences the set point of the lipostat in humans.  (Location 2034)\n\n---\nThe trick, as with all diets, is sticking with it, because just as the set point can go down, it can go right back up if you return to your former eating habits. And that means designing an eating plan you can live with for the long haul. For most people, a “bland liquid diet” like those I described isn’t a viable long-term solution, but keeping added fats, sugars, salt, and calorie-dense highly rewarding foods to a modest level may be.  (Location 2050)\n\n---\nSecond, focusing the diet on less rewarding foods may make it easier to lose weight and maintain weight loss because the lipostat doesn’t fight it as vigorously. This may be part of the explanation for why all weight-loss diets seem to work to some extent—even those that are based on diametrically opposed principles, such as low-fat, low-carbohydrate, Paleo, and vegan diets. Because each diet excludes major reward factors, they may all lower the adiposity set point somewhat.  (Location 2056)\n\n---\nHis findings show, not surprisingly, that exercise attenuates weight gain in rats when they’re offered a fattening diet.107 Yet Levin’s data also reveal that fit rats aren’t just leaner—they actively defend a lower adiposity set point than sedentary rats on the same diet. This is actually quite consistent with human studies, in which physically fit people are better able to resist fat gain in the face of overeating. It appears that exercise helps keep the lipostat happy at a lower set point.  (Location 2062)\n\n---\nIn the end, the evidence suggests that if you can maintain a high level of physical activity, it will probably help you prevent fat gain, accelerate fat loss, and maintain that loss. But it only works if you actually do it—and even then, the degree of fat loss depends on how effectively your brain compensates for the lost calories by increasing your appetite.  (Location 2098)\n\n---\nIn fact, many people report that low-carbohydrate diets help them curb their appetite and cravings, and the research backs this up. When people go on a low-carbohydrate diet, their spontaneous calorie intake drops substantially—even though they usually aren’t making any deliberate effort to eat fewer calories.  (Location 2104)\n\n---\nbetween them, which together perform countless unique tasks. Adding to the challenge, most of the chemical signals that regulate eating and adiposity are used for other purposes elsewhere in the brain and body. This makes it very difficult to target your circuit of interest without collateral damage. Imagine trying to drive nails into your wall with a sledgehammer: you may get a nail in sometimes, but you’re also going to put holes in your drywall. Because of this, most drugs that impact food intake have unacceptable side effects, such as the dangerous psychological effects of the drug rimonabant (“reverse marijuana”) we encountered earlier. Very few of the weight-loss drugs identified so far have acceptable side effects, and the few that do aren’t the silver bullets we wish they were.  (Location 2236)\n\n---\nNow it’s time for a reality check: We still don’t know to what extent these changes actually contribute to obesity, rather than being a result of obesity, or simply passively associating with the fattening process. We’ll have to do more research to figure that out. However, what we can conclude is that the hypothalamus is under duress in obesity and that this is likely caused (at least in part) by the unhealthy food we eat. In response to this challenge, the hypothalamus activates a broad swath of cellular stress response pathways, and some of these have the potential to dampen leptin signaling and contribute to the fattening process.122 This likely operates in parallel with the set-point-altering effects of food reward and protein intake we encountered in the last chapter.  (Location 2300)\n\n---\nLet’s recap what I’ve proposed thus far. We overeat because we’re surrounded by seductive, calorie-dense food that’s a great deal. The food’s high reward value increases the set point of the lipostat, though not necessarily permanently, and this further facilitates overeating. At the same time, overeating itself spikes leptin levels and injures the hypothalamus by a mechanism we have yet to nail down (likely involving diet quality in addition to quantity). These two simultaneous hits cause the hypothalamus to lose sensitivity to the leptin hormone, meaning that it requires more leptin, and therefore more body fat, to hold off the starvation response that drives us to overeat. This time, the increase in your set point is permanent, or at least difficult to reverse. The lower limit of your comfortable weight creeps up.  (Location 2342)\n\n---\nWhite bread, as expected, had a low satiety index relative to other foods, meaning it delivers little satiety per unit calorie. Whole-grain bread, in contrast, had a significantly higher satiety index. Calorie-dense bakery products, like cake, croissants, and doughnuts, had the lowest satiety index of all foods tested. Fruit, meat, and beans tended to have a high satiety index. Plain potatoes were off the charts—far more filling than any other food. Holt and colleagues noted that “simple ‘whole’ foods such as the fruits, potatoes, steak and fish were the most satiating of all foods tested.”  (Location 2467)\n\n---\nThe first is calorie density; in other words, the volume of food per calorie.128 For example, oatmeal is mostly water, so it has a much lower calorie density than crackers, which are nutritionally similar but contain little water. The lower the calorie density of the item, the more satiety it produced per unit calorie—and the effect was extremely robust.  (Location 2472)\n\n---\nNeck and neck with calorie density was another factor we’ve encountered before: palatability. The more palatable a food, the less filling it was. Again, this makes sense. Palatable foods are those that the brain intuitively views as highly valuable, and the brain is quite good at removing barriers to their consumption.  (Location 2478)\n\n---\nThe third most influential factor Holt and colleagues identified is a food’s fat content. The more fat it contained, the less filling it was per calorie. People often find this counterintuitive, because when they eat high-fat foods, they feel extremely full. The key to understanding this is to remember that we’re talking about fullness per unit calorie. If you eat a stick of butter, you may feel full, but you will also have eaten over 800 Calories—the equivalent of two and a half large baked potatoes. Isolated fats like butter and oil are the most calorie-dense substances in the human diet by far, mostly because fat delivers nine Calories per gram versus only four for carbohydrate and protein. Isolated fats also increase the palatability of food. For these reasons, adding fat to food is a highly effective way to increase your calorie intake without increasing your satiety much, and limiting added fat helps reduce calorie intake without sacrificing satiety.  (Location 2486)\n\n---\nIf your goal is to eat fewer calories without going hungry, high-satiety foods will help. These are items that have some combination of low calorie density, moderate palatability, high protein, and/or high fiber, such as beans, lentils, fresh fruit, vegetables, potatoes and sweet potatoes, fresh meat and seafood, oatmeal, avocados, yogurt, and eggs. The exceptionally high satiety value of potatoes is undoubtedly one of the reasons why the “potato diet” we encountered in chapter 3 is effective. But if you cover your potato with calorie-dense flavorings such as butter and cheese, or deep-fry it into french fries, all bets are off.  (Location 2522)\n\n---\nIn a carefully controlled overfeeding study, his team showed that the primary reason some people readily burn off excess calories is that they ramp up a form of calorie burning called “non-exercise activity thermogenesis” (NEAT). NEAT is basically a fancy term for fidgeting. When certain people overeat, their brains boost calorie expenditure by making them fidget, change posture frequently, and make other small movements throughout the day. It’s an involuntary process, and Levine’s data show that it can incinerate nearly 700 Calories per day! The “most gifted” of Levine’s subjects gained less than a pound of body fat from eating 1,000 extra Calories per day for eight weeks. Yet the strength of the response was highly variable, and the “least gifted” of Levine’s subjects didn’t increase NEAT at all, shunting all the excess calories into fat tissue and gaining over nine pounds of body fat. For Levine, the study highlighted the importance of light physical activity throughout the day, which inspired him to invent the treadmill desk.130  (Location 2557)\n\n---\nHowever, by looking at the genes that have been identified so far (which were identified precisely because they’re the most influential), we can gain unbiased insights into the biological processes that underlie garden-variety obesity.131 By now, you should have a pretty good guess what organ these genes tend to influence: the brain. Although some genes relate to other processes such as fat metabolism, the lion’s share exert their influence in the brain, and of those, many act via brain circuits that are already known to regulate food intake and adiposity (such as POMC neurons and their downstream targets). This suggests that genetic differences in brain function are the primary reason why some people are fatter than others.  (Location 2593)\n\n---\nWell, I suppose that’s that: If you have fat genes, you’re destined to be fat. Or are you? A century ago in the United States, people carried the same genes we do today, yet few people had obesity. What has changed isn’t our genes, it’s our environment—our food, our cars, our jobs. This leads us to a critical conclusion about obesity genes: In most cases, they don’t actually make us fat, they simply make us susceptible to a fattening environment. In the absence of a fattening environment, they rarely cause obesity. As Francis Collins, geneticist and director of the National Institutes of Health, is fond of saying, “Genetics loads the gun, and environment pulls the trigger.”  (Location 2600)\n\n---\nTogether, they lead us to two surprising conclusions: The first is that circadian desynchrony accelerates weight gain when rodents are fed a fattening diet. The second, even more striking conclusion is that fattening rodent diets aren’t particularly fattening when they’re only available during the appropriate time of day! This suggests that what is really fattening in these experiments is not simply fattening food but the combination of fattening food and circadian desynchrony.  (Location 2866)\n\n---\nHow do these uncontrollable, often social, stressors affect food intake? Remarkably, it depends entirely on the food that’s available. When Wilson’s team feeds its monkeys healthy, unrefined, high-fiber chow, stressed subordinate monkeys eat less and lose weight while dominant monkeys maintain weight. Yet when the researchers give the monkeys a choice between standard chow and a very rewarding high-fat, high-sugar diet, the monkeys’ eating behavior changes dramatically. First of all, not surprisingly, both dominant and submissive animals prefer the rewarding diet and eat it at the expense of the healthy diet. Yet the dominant animals keep eating the same amount of food as before. In contrast, the stressed subordinates double their daily calorie intake. So in the context of a strict healthy diet, stress makes monkeys undereat, whereas when they have a choice between healthy fare and junk food, they overeat spectacularly. Following up on this finding, when Wilson’s team blocks the effects of CRF in the monkeys’ brains, knocking out a key component of the threat response system, the subordinate monkeys stop overeating. This confirms that overeating in stressed monkeys, and perhaps ourselves as well, is a direct result of the activation of the threat response system in the brain.  (Location 3007)\n\n---\nEpel’s group has found that some people secrete high levels of cortisol in response to experimental stressors under lab conditions, while others don’t secrete much cortisol at all. The high secretors tend to eat more food when they’re stressed, while the low secretors don’t. Together, this paints a fairly coherent picture suggesting that cortisol may be a key reason why everyday stress can cause overeating and fat accumulation around the midsection. And it also helps explain why only certain people overeat in response to stress.  (Location 3071)\n\n---\nAs predicted by Dallman’s comfort food hypothesis, the group that drank sugar water showed a smaller stress response than the group that drank plain water. It appeared that sugar helped them feel better in the face of stress.152 Yet it’s not just sugar: Dallman and others have since shown that giving rats access to a high-fat food does the same thing.  (Location 3111)\n\n---\nShe hypothesized that sugar’s stress-busting effect is due to its metabolic impact on the body, not its rewarding effects in the brain, and therefore that saccharin would be ineffective. “The result,” explains Ulrich-Lai, “was completely opposite my hypothesis. The saccharin worked just as well as sugar.” Subsequent experiments confirmed that the sweet taste itself was responsible  (Location 3118)\n\n---\nUlrich-Lai’s findings have a valuable practical implication: The brain contains a natural stress relief pathway that we can tap into using a variety of everyday behaviors. “If we can understand that [built-in] stress relief pathway,” explains Ulrich-Lai, “then we might be able to find other ways to target it, either behaviorally or using drugs.”  (Location 3132)\n\n---\nThe reward system collects food-related cues from our external sense organs and our digestive tract, and guides us toward valuable foods by helping us learn and motivating our behavior. What we experience is that we crave and enjoy certain foods more than others, and we develop deeply ingrained eating habits around the foods we enjoy. Unfortunately, this system evolved in an ancient world where calories were hard to come by, and obtaining them required a lot of work, and therefore motivation. In the modern affluent world, where calorie-dense, highly rewarding foods are ubiquitous, our hardwired motivation to eat remains strong, and it drives us to overconsume.  (Location 3177)\n\n---\nThe lipostat is a third system, located primarily in the hypothalamus, which nonconsciously regulates adiposity by influencing appetite, our responsiveness to seductive food cues, and our metabolic rate. It takes its cues primarily from the hormone leptin, which is produced by fat tissue, although it also responds to food reward, protein intake, physical activity, stress, and possibly sleep (as well as other factors that are beyond the scope of this book). The lipostat has one job: to prevent your adiposity from decreasing. And it’s very good at what it does, because in the world of our ancestors, losing weight meant having fewer offspring. This is the system that makes weight loss difficult and often temporary, and it may also be part of the reason why our weight tends to creep up over the years. It partially explains why people with obesity tend to eat more than lean people, making obesity a self-sustaining state. When the lipostat squares off with our best intentions to eat the right amount and stay slim, it usually wins in the end.  (Location 3189)\n\n---\nOne of the reasons why modern food tends to be so exceptionally fattening is that it doesn’t provide the cues the satiety system needs to appropriately regulate calorie intake. We tend to use the sensation of fullness as an intuitive signal that we’ve eaten enough, so when we eat calorie-dense, low-fiber, low-protein, highly palatable foods that provide little satiety per calorie, we overeat substantially without even realizing it.  (Location 3201)\n\n---\nThe most straightforward way to do this is to choose foods that send strong satiety signals to the brain stem but contain a moderate number of calories. These are foods that have a lower calorie density, higher protein and/or fiber content, and a moderate level of palatability. This tends to include simple foods that are closer to their natural state, such as fresh fruit, vegetables, potatoes, fresh meats, seafood, eggs, yogurt, whole grains, beans, and lentils. Bread is surprisingly calorie-dense, even when it’s made from whole grains, so it can be easy to overeat. It may be preferable to get your starch from water-rich foods like potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans, and oatmeal than flour-based foods like bread and crackers  (Location 3405)\n\n---\nOur distant ancestors had a word for exercise: life. Movement has always been a key part of our species’ daily activity, and our bodies require it to function properly. It’s a fundamental ingredient for good health, physical and cognitive performance, emotional health, and healthy aging.

He submitted a fix in the run-up to the release, expanding the available RAM on the device from 160 Mbytes to 192 Mbytes, giving the OS and all applications 20% more memory to play with, which was a significant boost on this very memory-constrained system. The trick was that he knew where to find that memory because he had hidden it in the first place. The kernel is responsible for making memory available for the rest of the system to use. When he first brought up the kernel on the G1, he configured it to report less memory that it actually had. To the rest of the system, there was effectively 32Mb less memory for use than was physically available in the hardware. He did this with the certain knowledge that every developer would use all available memory if it was there, but they’d work within a tighter budget if they had to.

Approximately 85 percent of supergrowers were unable to maintain their growth rates, and once lost, less than a quarter were able to recapture them.  (Location 18)\n\n---\nFirst, growth happens in phases: from start-up to billion-dollar giant, growth stories typically unfold as a prelude, act one, and act two. In act one, there are five critical enablers of growth: market, monetization model, rapid adoption, stealth, and incentives. A third principle is that the drivers for growth in act two are different. Successful strategies in act two include expanding the act-one offer to new geographies or channels, extending the act-one success to a new product market, or transforming the act-one offer into a platform.  (Location 22)\n\n---\nThe rules of the road in other industries do not apply here. If a health-care company grew at 20 percent annually, its managers and investors would be happy.

I have no intention of becoming a bicycle mechanic, but I do know how to change a tire. Likewise, you don’t need to climb fifty feet onto a billboard to help take back our shared visual environment. Pushing this discussion outward to broader and broader groups of people is essential. There are also many interventionist tactics with very low barriers to entry, like keeping a marker in your pocket and crossing out ads you find offensive, or putting up small stickers that challenge the dominant narrative. The first step to having a say in your visual space is literally having your say. As Hugh Masekela once said, “All that remains to do is to do.”  (Location 137)\n\n---\nIt only became a dirty word because the Germans used it, but it is exactly the same method.

As they were slotting a subvert over the original ad in an ad space, a commuter interjected and blustered at them: “You want arresting! Why don’t you just pay for your advertising, like everyone else?” It serves to neatly illustrate both the perceived sanctity of the private nature of these public spaces—that anyone interfering with them should be arrested—and also the misconception that these spaces are somehow open to all.41 The reason the SPG were subvertising is because not everyone can afford to access those spaces.  (Location 351)\n\n---\nOne of the reasons private provision of public infrastructure may be tolerated is that we imagine the cost is shouldered by the beneficent provider, which represents a saving to the public purse. But advertising spend has the effect of increasing the cost of the product advertised, and that cost is ultimately passed on to the consumer. There is no such thing as a free bench.47  (Location 374)\n\n---\nSome subvertisers, too, are wary of government-enacted bans. Rather than a citywide ban on advertising, Jordan Seiler would prefer spaces to be available for all citizens to use: “This should be self-organised, you should just allow public messaging and scrawl on the streets. That’s probably utopian, but I think a more viable solution would be to create places and structures that would support an open curation of some sort.”60 He also questions the motives behind the bans,61 and points out the ban in São Paulo has only been partial: at the same time as the Clean City Law was introduced, the city signed a contract with JCDecaux to provide advertising-funded bus shelters. By eliminating the haphazard clutter of billboard advertising, it’s entirely possible that the Clean City Law will benefit the companies that hold a monopoly on advertising infrastructure, which is slowly being reintroduced in a “controlled manner.” This effectively eliminates the competition and means that a few big companies are once again allowed to dominate.

You’re doing it for your reasons. ‘Yes, this assignment is pointless, and it bugs me to waste time, but I want to earn my professor’s respect. My own goal justifies doing it his way.’ ” As these examples illustrate, even when the first order of justification is missing—“Does this expectation make sense on its own?”— Questioners can focus on the second order of justification—“Does it make sense for me to meet this otherwise unjustified expectation, for my own reasons?” It’s important for Questioners to remind themselves to do what they must so that they can do what they want.

Most jobs could be filled by all of the Tendencies, because so many factors contribute to success in a particular career. After all, the Tendency describes only how a person responds to an expectation, not what the person’s talents, personality, intelligence, or interests are.

When what others expect from Obligers is what they expect from themselves, they have the life they want.  ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06VXTGYCS&location=1422))\n\n---\nThis can be a serious problem. An Obliger who dreams of launching a start-up, or of switching careers midstream, or of giving up fast food may feel very frustrated by his or her inability to follow through on these aims. An Obliger summarized: “Promises made to yourself can be broken. It’s the promises made to others that should never be broken.” Obligers depend on outer accountability to meet both their outer and inner expectations; if that accountability is missing, they struggle.  ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06VXTGYCS&location=1435))\n\n---\nSome imaginative Obligers can even create outer accountability by thinking of themselves in the third person. “I don’t feel a lot of obligation to do things for myself right now,” one Obliger told me, “but I do feel guilty if I don’t meet future-me’s needs. I hate going to the gym, but future-me will wish I’d stuck to my workout schedule—even though current-me hates it.”  ([Location 1531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06VXTGYCS&location=1531))\n\n---\nI suspect that when an institution supplies a lot of external accountability, it doesn’t break down Obligers’ self-discipline; it simply makes it unnecessary for Obligers to develop their own personal systems of external accountability. In ordinary life, many Obligers realize they need accountability in order to succeed. But when an institution supplies outer accountability, the Obligers don’t need to do it for themselves—and when they’re released from that institution’s expectations, they often struggle.  ([Location 1648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06VXTGYCS&location=1648))\n\n---\nBecause Obligers often misunderstand the patterns of Obliger behavior, they’re prone to a common, sometimes serious mistake. Obligers expect that if they could only free themselves from some burdensome outer expectation—for instance, by leaving a demanding job—they’d then find it easy to meet their expectations for themselves. Warning! In most cases, without the addition of some sort of external accountability, the absence of external expectations doesn’t help Obligers meet their inner expectations. As one Obliger told me, “Trying to clear space in your life for your own goals doesn’t work for an Obliger. I made that mistake for years.”  ([Location 1710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06VXTGYCS&location=1710))\n\n**Tags:** [[favorite]] \n\n---\nOnce established as entrepreneurs, Obligers may find it easy to meet the external commitments of their work—meeting client deadlines, filing taxes, answering the phone—yet struggle with inner-generated tasks, such as networking, building the business, or saying no to requests that waste their time or to clients who are overly demanding. As always, the solution is to find external systems of deadlines and boundaries.

People from such cultures are conditioned from childhood to assume a low level of shared context—that is, few shared reference points and comparatively little implicit knowledge linking speaker and listener.  ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=552))\n\n---\nIn low-context cultures, effective communication must be simple, clear, and explicit in order to effectively pass the message, and most communicators will obey this requirement, usually without being fully conscious of it. The United States is the lowest-context culture in the world, followed by Canada and Australia, the Netherlands and Germany, and the United Kingdom.  ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=556))\n\n---\nThis is where I learned the traditional American rule for successfully transferring a powerful message to an audience: “Tell them what you are going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them what you’ve told them.” This is the philosophy of low-context communication in a nutshell.  ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=563))\n\n---\nBy contrast, the United States, a country with a mere few hundred years of shared history, has been shaped by enormous inflows of immigrants from various countries around the world, all with different histories, different languages, and different backgrounds. Because they had little shared context, Americans learned quickly that if they wanted to pass a message, they had to make it as explicit and clear as possible, with little room for ambiguity and misunderstanding.  ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=637))\n\n---\nOne interesting quirk is that in high-context cultures, the more educated and sophisticated you are, the greater your ability to both speak and listen with an understanding of implicit, layered messages. By contrast, in low-context cultures, the most educated and sophisticated business people are those who communicate in a clear, explicit way. The result is that the chairman of a French or Japanese company is likely to be a lot more high-context than those who work on the shop floor of the same company, while the chairman of an American or Australian organization is likely to be more low-context than those with entry-level jobs in the same organization. In this respect, education tends to move individuals toward a more extreme version of the dominant cultural tendency.  ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=685))\n\n---\nSome cultures that are low-context and explicit may be cryptically indirect with negative criticism, while other cultures that speak between the lines may be explicit, straight talkers when telling you what you did wrong. As we will see, the French and the Americans are not the only cultures that swap places on the Communicating and Evaluating scales.  ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=951))\n\n---\nManagers in different parts of the world are conditioned to give feedback in drastically different ways. The Chinese manager learns never to criticize a colleague openly or in front of others, while the Dutch manager learns always to be honest and to give the message straight. Americans are trained to wrap positive messages around negative ones, while the French are trained to criticize passionately and provide positive feedback sparingly. Having a clear understanding of these differences and strategies for navigating them is crucial for leaders of cross-cultural teams.  ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=997))\n\n---\nNote, too, that several countries have different positions on the Evaluating scale from those they occupy on the Communicating scale. For this reason, you may be surprised by the gap between our stereotyped assumptions about certain countries and their placement on the Evaluating scale. The explanation lies in the fact that stereotypes about how directly people speak generally reflect their cultures’ position on the Communicating scale, not the Evaluating scale. Thus, the French, Spanish, and Russians are generally stereotyped as being indirect communicators because of their high-context, implicit communication style, despite the fact that they give negative feedback more directly. Americans are stereotyped as direct by most of the world, yet when they give negative feedback they are less direct than many European cultures.  ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=1061))\n\n---\nThird, frame your behavior in cultural terms. Talk about the cultural differences that explain your communication style. If possible, show appreciation for the other culture while laughing humbly at your own. Someone in Dulac’s position might say, “In the U.S., you are so good at openly appreciating one another. In France, we aren’t in the habit of voicing positive feedback. We might think it, but we don’t say it!” To those she works with frequently, Dulac might also explain her natural feedback style: “When I say ‘okay,’ you should hear ‘very good.’ And when I say ‘good,’ you should hear ‘excellent.’”  ([Location 1224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=1224))\n\n---\nBy contrast, in a principles-first language class, learning starts with understanding the grammatical principles underpinning the language structure. Once you have a solid initial grasp of the grammar and vocabulary, you begin to practice using the language. This is the way my husband learned English in his French school, and ironically, his knowledge of English grammar is far superior to that of many Americans. The disadvantage is that students spend less time practicing the language, which may mean they write it better than they speak it.  ([Location 1405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=1405))\n\n---\nSecond, think carefully about your larger objectives before you mix cultures up. If your goal is innovation or creativity, the more cultural diversity the better, as long as the process is managed carefully. But if your goal is simple speed and efficiency, then monocultural is probably better than multicultural. Sometimes, it is simply better to leave Rome to the Romans.  ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=1677))\n\n---\nThe countries most influenced by the Vikings consistently rank as some of the most egalitarian and consensus-oriented cultures in the world today. So it is no surprise that, even today, when you walk into a meeting room in Copenhagen or Stockholm, it is often impossible to spot the boss.  ([Location 1877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=1877))\n\n---\nOur third historical clue relates to the distance between the people and God in particular religions. Countries with Protestant cultures tend to fall further to the egalitarian side of the scale than those with a more Catholic tradition. One interpretation of this pattern is that the Protestant Reformation largely removed the traditional hierarchy from the church. In many strains of Protestantism, the individual speaks directly to God instead of speaking to God through the priest, the bishop, and the pope.  ([Location 1879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=1879))\n\n---\nIn a consensual culture, the decision making may take quite a long time, since everyone is consulted. But once the decision has been made, the implementation is quite rapid, since everyone has completely bought in and the decision is fixed and inflexible—a decision with a capital D, we might say. Thus, the moment of making the decision is taken quite seriously as the pivotal point in the process. By contrast, in a top-down culture, the decision-making responsibility is invested in an individual. In this kind of culture, decisions tend to be made quickly, early in the process, by one person (likely the boss). But each decision is also flexible—a decision with a lowercase d. As more discussions occur, new information arises, or differing opinions surface, decisions may be easily revisited or altered. So plans are subject to continual revision—which means that implementation can take quite a long time  ([Location 2177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=2177))\n\n---\nI really wanted to respond by saying, “I have absolutely no opinion. You are the boss—please make a decision so we can get back to work.” Instead I reminded myself of how delighted I had felt when Per had told me that he favored a consensual decision-making style. So I simply replied that I supported whatever the group decided. In the weeks to come, as many other topics got the same treatment, I realized that my gut instinct about myself had been wrong. In fact, consensual decision making was not at all the way I preferred to work. I also understood why Per had felt it necessary to explain his consensual approach to me so carefully before we started working together. He later described to me how it feels to be Swedish working with Americans, who are “too busy to work as good team members” and “always trying to impose a decision for decision’s sake without soliciting the necessary feedback so that others feel bought in.” That was me that Per was describing!  ([Location 2230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=2230))\n\n---\nThe Japanese ringi system epitomizes a culture where decisions take a long time to be made, as everyone is invested in building a group consensus. But once the decision is made, it is generally fixed and the implementation may be very rapid, because each individual is on board. The result is a decision with a capital D.

They smile frequently at strangers, move quickly to first-name usage, share information about themselves, and ask personal questions of those they hardly know. But after a little friendly interaction with a peach person, you may suddenly get to the hard shell of the pit where the peach protects his real self. In these cultures, friendliness does not equal friendship.  ([Location 2531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=2531))\n\n---\nIn coconut cultures such as these, people are more closed (like the tough shell of a coconut) with those they don’t have friendships with. They rarely smile at strangers, ask casual acquaintances personal questions, or offer personal information to those they don’t know intimately. It takes a while to get through the initial hard shell, but as you do, people will become gradually warmer and friendlier. While relationships are built up slowly, they tend to last longer.

But as I reflected on his words, I began to recognize in Krooner what I hadn’t really understood about myself. Krooner felt exhausted after a night of partying because “he couldn’t concentrate any longer.” But his relationship-based colleagues had left concentration behind when they entered the restaurant.

Perhaps he has done business with your brother for years and your brother vouches for him; perhaps you’ve worked with his cousins or close friends on other projects; or perhaps you’ve had time to get to know him personally and you’ve concluded that he is trustworthy. You believe you can do business with the shopkeeper because your relationship with him (direct or indirect) provides a safety net that replaces the role of the legal system in more developed countries.

Trust is like insurance—it’s an investment you need to make up front, before the need arises.  ([Location 2802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=2802))\n\n---\nI soon learned that, if I wanted to encourage team debate, it was important to use phrases like “I do not quite understand your point” and “Please explain more about why you think that.” These expressions encouraged give-and-take rather than shutting down the conversation completely.  ([Location 3068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=3068))\n\n---\nAlthough he has learned to work in both the French and Anglo-Saxon environments, he feels that for any French person working with Americans or British, the Disagreeing scale is one of the most important—and challenging. By comparison with the French, the Americans value harmony and equilibrium. Under the umbrella of their written constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, Americans have developed a highly complex, multi-ethnic citizenry characterized by peaceful, tolerant coexistence (much of the time). As a result, Americans tend to perceive dissent as a threat to their unity. “United we stand, divided we fall,” is the basis for many social interactions in the United States.  ([Location 3104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=3104))\n\n---\nI learned a very simple trick, perhaps obvious to someone who is British or American but not a bit obvious to me. Before expressing disagreement, I now always explain, “Let me play devil’s advocate, so we can explore both sides.” Most groups seem happy to do this, as long as I am clear about what I am doing and why I am doing it.  ([Location 3112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=3112))\n\n---\nAnthropologist Edward T. Hall was one of the first researchers to explore differences in societal approaches to time. In The Dance of Life: The Other Dimension of Time, Hall referred to monochronic (M-time) cultures and polychronic (P-time) cultures. M-time cultures view time as tangible and concrete: “We speak of time as being saved, spent, wasted, lost, made up, crawling, killing and running out. These metaphors must be taken seriously. M-time scheduling is used as a classification system that orders life. These rules apply to everything except death.”1 By contrast, P-time cultures take a flexible approach to time, involvement of people, and completion of transactions: “Appointments are not taken seriously and, as a consequence, are frequently broken as it is more likely to be considered a point rather than a ribbon in the road.  ([Location 3206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=3206))\n\n---\nIn the wake of Hall’s work, psychologist Robert Levine began meticulously observing and analyzing various cultural approaches to clocks.2 He noted that some cultures measure time in five-minute intervals, while other cultures barely use clocks and instead schedule their day on what Levine calls “event time”: before lunch, after sunrise, or in the case of the locals in Burundi, “when the cows come home.”  ([Location 3219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XCJ125R&location=3219))\n\n---\nFor example, if you are a farmer in the Nigerian countryside, most of the farmwork is done by people, and you likely have few machines. In this environment, it doesn’t matter much if you start work at 7:00 or 7:12 or even 7:32. What matters is that your work structure is flexible enough to adapt with changes in the natural environment, and that you have invested in the critical relationships needed to keep your workers loyal in times of drought or flooding, erosion or insect infestation. In this environment, productivity and profit are directly linked to the flexibility and the relationships of the person in charge. Indeed, the importance of relationships seems to be a key to understanding the Scheduling scale. It’s only logical that if relationships are a priority, you will put them before the clock. Thus it’s natural that cultures that put a premium on relationship building tend, with a few exceptions, to fall on the flexible-time side of the Scheduling scale (see Figure 8.1).

What’s new is the requirement for twenty-first century leaders to be prepared to understand a wider, richer array of work styles than ever before and to be able to determine what aspects of an interaction are simply a result of personality and which are a result of differences in cultural perspective.

Of course, I was made aware that somebody’s race mattered, and if race was discussed, it would be theirs, not mine. Yet a critical component of cross-racial skill building is the ability to sit with the discomfort of being seen racially, of having to proceed as if our race matters (which it does). Being seen racially is a common trigger of white fragility, and thus, to build our stamina, white people must face the first challenge: naming our race.  ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K356517&location=169))\n\n---\nHow can I say that if you are white, your opinions on racism are most likely ignorant, when I don’t even know you? I can say so because nothing in mainstream US culture gives us the information we need to have the nuanced understanding of arguably the most complex and enduring social dynamic of the last several hundred years.  ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K356517&location=178))\n\n---\nInterrupting the forces of racism is ongoing, lifelong work because the forces conditioning us into racist frameworks are always at play; our learning will never be finished. Yet our simplistic definition of racism—as intentional acts of racial discrimination committed by immoral individuals—engenders a confidence that we are not part of the problem and that our learning is thus complete.  ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K356517&location=192))\n\n---\nIndividualism is a story line that creates, communicates, reproduces, and reinforces the concept that each of us is a unique individual and that our group memberships, such as race, class, or gender, are irrelevant to our opportunities. Individualism claims that there are no intrinsic barriers to individual success and that failure is not a consequence of social structures but comes from individual character. According to the ideology of individualism, race is irrelevant.  ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K356517&location=207))\n\n---\nIn addition to challenging our sense of ourselves as individuals, tackling group identity also challenges our belief in objectivity. If group membership is relevant, then we don’t see the world from the universal human perspective but from the perspective of a particular kind of human. In this way, both ideologies are disrupted. Thus, reflecting on our racial frames is particularly challenging for many white people, because we are taught that to have a racial viewpoint is to be biased.

I ask readers to make the specific adjustments they think are necessary to their situation, rather than reject the evidence entirely. For example, perhaps you grew up in poverty, or are an Ashkenazi Jew of European heritage, or were raised in a military family. Perhaps you grew up in Canada, Hawaii, or Germany, or had people of color in your family. None of these situations exempts you from the forces of racism, because no aspect of society is outside of these forces.

How did X shape me as a result of also being white?” Setting aside your sense of uniqueness is a critical skill that will allow you to see the big picture of the society in which we live; individualism will not.

Once new immigrants learn English and adapt to American culture and customs, they become Americans. In reality, only European immigrants were allowed to melt, or assimilate, into dominant culture in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, because, regardless of their ethnic identities, these immigrants were perceived to be white and thus could belong.

Still, I understand that the term is very charged for many white people, especially older white people who associate the term with extreme hate groups. However, I hope to have made clear that white supremacy is something much more pervasive and subtle than the actions of explicit white nationalists. White supremacy describes the culture we live in, a culture that positions white people and all that is associated with them (whiteness) as ideal. White supremacy is more than the idea that whites are superior to people of color; it is the deeper premise that supports this idea—the definition of whites as the norm or standard for human, and people of color as a deviation from that norm.

Every moment we spend in those environments reinforces powerful aspects of the white racial frame, including a limited worldview, a reliance on deeply problematic depictions of people of color, comfort in segregation with no sense that there might be value in knowing people of color, and internalized superiority. In turn, our capacity to engage constructively across racial lines becomes profoundly limited.

An example I often share occurred when I was co-leading a workshop with an African American man. A white participant said to him, “I don’t see race; I don’t see you as black.” My co-trainer’s response was, “Then how will you see racism?” He then explained to her that he was black, he was confident that she could see this, and that his race meant that he had a very different experience in life than she did. If she were ever going to understand or challenge racism, she would need to acknowledge this difference. Pretending that she did not notice that he was black was not helpful to him in any way, as it denied his reality—indeed, it refused his reality—and kept hers insular and unchallenged. This pretense that she did not notice his race assumed that he was “just like her,” and in so doing, she projected her reality onto him. For example, I feel welcome at work so you must too; I have never felt that my race mattered, so you must feel that yours doesn’t either. But of course, we do see the race of other people, and race holds deep social meaning for us.

This is yet another example of the concept of whiteness as property discussed earlier: whiteness has psychological advantages that translate into material returns.

While I am aware that race has been used unfairly against people of color, I haven’t been taught to see this problem as any responsibility of mine; as long as I personally haven’t done anything I am aware of, racism is a nonissue. This freedom from responsibility gives me a level of racial relaxation and emotional and intellectual space that people of color are not afforded as they move through their day.

Within this paradigm, to suggest that I am racist is to deliver a deep moral blow—a kind of character assassination. Having received this blow, I must defend my character, and that is where all my energy will go—to deflecting the charge, rather than reflecting on my behavior. In this way, the good/bad binary makes it nearly impossible to talk to white people about racism, what it is, how it shapes all of us, and the inevitable ways that we are conditioned to participate in it.  ([Location 1158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K356517&location=1158))\n\n---\nConceptualizing myself on an active continuum changes the question from whether I am or am not racist to a much more constructive question: Am I actively seeking to interrupt racism in this context?

It is not the mere presence of black people that is the problem; rather, it is blackness with ambition, with drive, with purpose, with aspirations, and with demands for full and equal citizenship. It is blackness that refuses to accept subjugation, to give up.”  ([Location 1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K356517&location=1515))\n\n---\nSociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, in his study of color-blind racism, describes an aspect of white fragility: “Because the new racial climate in America forbids the open expression of racially based feelings, views, and positions, when whites discuss issues that make them uncomfortable, they become almost incomprehensible.”7 Probing forbidden racial issues results in verbal incoherence—digressions, long pauses, repetition, and self-corrections. Bonilla-Silva suggests that this incoherent talk is a function of talking about race in a world that insists that race does not matter. This incoherence suggests that many white people are unprepared to explore, even on a preliminary level, their racial perspectives and to work to shift their understanding of racism. This reluctance maintains white power because the ability to determine which narratives are authorized and which are suppressed is the foundation of cultural domination. This reluctance has further implications, for if whites cannot explore alternate racial perspectives, they can only reinscribe white perspectives as universal.  ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K356517&location=1729))\n\n---\nThe above guidelines rest on the understanding that there is no face to save and the game is up; I know that I have blind spots and unconscious investments in racism. My investments are reinforced every day in mainstream society. I did not set this system up, but it does unfairly benefit me, I do use it to my advantage, and I am responsible for interrupting it. I need to work hard to change my role in this system, but I can’t do it alone. This understanding leads me to gratitude when others help me.  ([Location 1925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K356517&location=1925))\n\n---\nThese feelings, behaviors, and claims will probably be less familiar to readers, as they are all too rare. But when our fundamental understanding of racism is transformed, so are our assumptions and resultant behaviors. Imagine the difference in our environment, interactions, norms, and policies if the following list described our assumptions: Being good or bad is not relevant. Racism is a multilayered system embedded in our culture. All of us are socialized into the system of racism. Racism cannot be avoided. Whites have blind spots on racism, and I have blind spots on racism. Racism is complex, and I don’t have to understand every nuance of the feedback to validate that feedback. Whites are / I am unconsciously invested in racism. Bias is implicit and unconscious; I don’t expect to be aware of mine without a lot of ongoing effort. Giving us white people feedback on our racism is risky for people of color, so we can consider the feedback a sign of trust. Feedback on white racism is difficult to give; how I am given the feedback is not as relevant as the feedback itself. Authentic antiracism is rarely comfortable. Discomfort is key to my growth and thus desirable. White comfort maintains the racial status quo, so discomfort is necessary and important. I must not confuse comfort with safety; as a white person, I am safe in discussions of racism. The antidote to guilt is action. It takes courage to break with white solidarity; how can I support those who do? I bring my group’s history with me; history matters. Given my socialization, it is much more likely that I am the one who doesn’t understand the issue. Nothing exempts me from the forces of racism. My analysis must be intersectional (a recognition that my other social identities—class, gender, ability—inform how I was socialized into the racial system). Racism hurts (even kills) people of color 24-7. Interrupting it is more important than my feelings, ego, or self-image.

Many people of color have assured me that they will not give up on me despite my racist patterns; they expect that I will have racist behavior given the society that socialized me. What they are looking for is not perfection but the ability to talk about what happened, the ability to repair. Unfortunately, it is rare for white people to own and repair our inevitable patterns of racism. Thus, relationships with white people tend to be less authentic for people of color.  ([Location 2195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K356517&location=2195))\n\n---\nHaving said that, I can offer a few strategies for trying to work with one another on our white fragility. First, I try to affirm a person’s perspective before I share mine, and when I do share mine, I try to point the finger inward, not outward. For example, I might say, “I can understand why you feel that way. I have felt that way myself. However, because of my opportunity to work with people of color and hear their perspectives, I have come to understand …” I then share what I have come to understand with the emphasis on how this understanding relates to me. While this strategy is not guaranteed to lower defensiveness, it’s difficult to argue with someone who has framed a response as her or his own personal insight.  ([Location 2265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K356517&location=2265))\n\n---\nNot naming the groups that face barriers only serves those who already have access; the assumption is that the access enjoyed by the controlling group is universal. For example, although we are taught that women were granted suffrage in 1920, we ignore the fact that it was white women who received full access or that it was white men who granted it. Not until the 1960s, through the Voting Rights Act, were all women—regardless of race—granted full access to suffrage. Naming who has access and who doesn’t guides our efforts in challenging injustice.

Peñalosa says that the automotive dominance is instantly tamed by car-free events as people have an opportunity to connect again with their streets: “All of a sudden people see that the streets are public space and belong to all of us, and things start clicking into other possibilities.”  ([Location 1636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZQH30TU&location=1636))\n\n---\nSo why would anyone want to ride in the first place? Just as Mayor Rob Ford declared in Toronto, many city leaders and residents think that riding a bike on city streets is suicidal. Bikes don’t belong on the road. Some cities even require that bike riders wear helmets, and politicians and bike opponents routinely suggest that bike registration or insurance would make streets safer. I think what’s crazy is that anyone would be content with city streets so dangerous that only a lunatic would ride a bike on them, or that some think the only way to deal with cyclists is to require that they armor themselves or to ban them from the road. If death-wish speed racers are the only ones lured to your streets, and if a helmet is the only counter weapon, the problem is a lot bigger than bike riders.

It separates bikes and vehicles, reducing the chance that a vehicle will illegally block the bike lane and organizing the street better for pedestrians, with safety islands that reduce crossing distances.

It means not fleeing your enemy, but knowing your enemy, which turns out not to be the world—contemptus mundi—but the channels through which you encounter it day to day. It also means giving yourself the critical break that media cycles and narratives will not, allowing yourself to believe in another world while living in this one. Unlike the libertarian blank slate that appeals to outer space, or even the communes that sought to break with historical time, this “other world” is not a rejection of the one we live in. Rather, it is a perfect image of this world when justice has been realized with and for everyone and everything that is already here. To stand apart is to look at the world (now) from the point of view of the world as it could be (the future), with all of the hope and sorrowful contemplation that this entails.

We need a Diogenes not just for entertainment, nor just to show that there are alternatives, but because stories like his contribute to our vocabulary of refusal even centuries later. When we hear about Diogenes blowing off Alexander the Great, it’s hard not to laugh and think, “Fuck yeah!” Although most people aren’t likely to do something so extreme, the story provides a locus for our wish to do so. But beyond showing that refusal is possible—highlighting the “cracks” in the crushingly habitual—Diogenes also has much to teach us about how to refuse. It’s important to note that, faced with the unrelenting hypocrisy of society, Diogenes did not flee to the mountains (like some philosophers) or kill himself (like still other philosophers). In other words, he neither assimilated to nor fully exited society; instead he lived in the midst of it, in a permanent state of refusal.

A real withdrawal of attention happens first and foremost in the mind. What is needed, then, is not a “once-and-for-all” type of quitting but ongoing training: the ability not just to withdraw attention, but to invest it somewhere else, to enlarge and proliferate it, to improve its acuity. We need to be able to think across different time scales when the mediascape would have us think in twenty-four-hour (or shorter) cycles, to pause for consideration when clickbait would have us click, to risk unpopularity by searching for context when our Facebook feed is an outpouring of unchecked outrage and scapegoating, to closely study the ways that media and advertising play upon our emotions, to understand the algorithmic versions of ourselves that such forces have learned to manipulate, and to know when we are being guilted, threatened, and gaslighted into reactions that come not from will and reflection but from fear and anxiety.

In those domains, which involved human behavior and where patterns did not clearly repeat, repetition did not cause learning. Chess, golf, and firefighting are exceptions, not the rule.

And they found it. Whether or not experience inevitably led to expertise, they agreed, depended entirely on the domain in question. Narrow experience made for better chess and poker players and firefighters, but not for better predictors of financial or political trends, or of how employees or patients would perform.

Our greatest strength is the exact opposite of narrow specialization. It is the ability to integrate broadly. According to Gary Marcus, a psychology and neural science professor who sold his machine learning company to Uber, “In narrow enough worlds, humans may not have much to contribute much longer. In more open-ended games, I think they certainly will. Not just games, in open ended real-world problems we’re still crushing the machines.

The bullet must be loaded in the rifle to kill the bird, and “then you have to cut the bird up with the dagger, since there’s no other way to do it.” These were just the introductions explaining the grouping task, not the actual questions.

Novaya Zemlya is in the Far North and there is always snow there. What colors are the bears there?” That time, no amount of pushing could get the remote villagers to answer. They would respond only with principles. “Your words can be answered only by someone who was there,” one man said, even though he had never been to England but had just answered the cotton question. But even a faint taste of modern work began to change that. Given the white bear puzzle, Abdull, forty-five and barely literate but chairman of a collective farm, would not give an answer confidently, but he did exercise formal logic. “To go by your words,” he said, “they should all be white.”  ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M6QPRRG&location=644))\n\n---\n“Even the best universities aren’t developing critical intelligence,” he told me. “They aren’t giving students the tools to analyze the modern world, except in their area of specialization.

If you’re asked to predict whether a particular horse will win a race or a particular politician will win an election, the more internal details you learn about any particular scenario—physical qualities of the specific horse, the background and strategy of the particular politician—the more likely you are to say that the scenario you are investigating will occur. Psychologists have shown repeatedly that the more internal details an individual can be made to consider, the more extreme their judgment becomes.

Less successful problem solvers are more like most students in the Ambiguous Sorting Task: they mentally classify problems only by superficial, overtly stated features, like the domain context.

And despite starting out behind in income because they had fewer specific skills, the Scots quickly caught up. Their counterparts in England and Wales were more often switching fields after college and after beginning a career even though they had more disincentive to switch, having focused on that field. With less sampling opportunity, more students headed down a narrow path before figuring out if it was a good one. The English and Welsh students were specializing so early that they were making more mistakes. Malamud’s conclusion: “The benefits to increased match quality . . . outweigh the greater loss in skills.” Learning stuff was less important than learning about oneself.

Rather than expecting an ironclad a priori answer to “Who do I really want to become?,” their work indicated that it is better to be a scientist of yourself, asking smaller questions that can actually be tested—“Which among my various possible selves should I start to explore now? How can I do that?” Be a flirt with your possible selves.* Rather than a grand plan, find experiments that can be undertaken quickly. “ Test-and-learn,” Ibarra told me, “not plan-and-implement.”  ([Location 2303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M6QPRRG&location=2303))\n\n---\nLike anyone eager to raise their match quality prospects, Michelangelo learned who he was—and whom he was carving—in practice, not in theory. He started with an idea, tested it, changed it, and readily abandoned it for a better project fit. Michelangelo might have fit well in Silicon Valley; he was a relentless iterator. He worked according to Ibarra’s new aphorism: “I know who I am when I see what I do.”  ([Location 2327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M6QPRRG&location=2327))\n\n---\nIf it was easily solved by people within the industry, it would have been solved by people within the industry,” Pegau said. “I think it happens more often than we’d love to admit, because we tend to view things with all the information we’ve gathered in our industry, and sometimes that puts us down a path that goes into a wall. It’s hard to back up and find another path.” Pegau was basically describing the Einstellung effect, a psychology term for the tendency of problem solvers to employ only familiar methods even if better ones are available.

The larger and more easily accessible the library of human knowledge, the more chances for inquisitive patrons to make connections at the cutting edge. An operation like InnoCentive, which at first blush seems totally counterintuitive, should become even more fruitful as specialization accelerates.  ([Location 2683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M6QPRRG&location=2683))\n\n---\nEminent physicist and mathematician Freeman Dyson styled it this way: we need both focused frogs and visionary birds. “Birds fly high in the air and survey broad vistas of mathematics out to the far horizon,” Dyson wrote in 2009. “They delight in concepts that unify our thinking and bring together diverse problems from different parts of the landscape. Frogs live in the mud below and see only the flowers that grow nearby. They delight in the details of particular objects, and they solve problems one at a time.” As a mathematician, Dyson labeled himself a frog, but contended, “It is stupid to claim that birds are better than frogs because they see farther, or that frogs are better than birds because they see deeper.” The world, he wrote, is both broad and deep. “We need birds and frogs working together to explore it.” Dyson’s concern was that science is increasingly overflowing with frogs, trained only in a narrow specialty and unable to change as science itself does. “This is a hazardous situation,” he warned, “for the young people and also for the future of science.”  ([Location 2836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M6QPRRG&location=2836))\n\n---\nThe specialists and the generalists, they found, both made contributions. One was not uniformly superior to the other. (They also found inventors who had neither significant depth nor breadth—they rarely made an impact.) The specialists were adept at working for a long time on difficult technical problems, and for anticipating development obstacles. The generalists tended to get bored working in one area for too long. They added value by integrating domains, taking technology from one area and applying it in others. Neither an inventor’s breadth nor their depth alone predicted the likelihood that one of their inventions would win the Carlton Award—the “Nobel Prize of 3M.”  ([Location 2883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M6QPRRG&location=2883))\n\n---\nHe became so interested in classifying innovators that he wrote a computer algorithm to analyze ten million patents from the last century and learn to identify and classify different types of inventors. Specialist contributions skyrocketed around and after World War II, but more recently have declined. “Specialists specifically peaked about 1985,” Ouderkirk told me. “And then declined pretty dramatically, leveled off about 2007, and the most recent data show it’s declining again, which I’m trying to understand.” He is careful to say that he can’t pinpoint a cause of the current trend. His hypothesis is that organizations simply don’t need as many specialists. “As information becomes more broadly available, the need for somebody to just advance a field isn’t as critical because in effect they are available to everybody,” he said.

When the National Transportation Safety Board analyzed its database of major flight accidents, it found that 73 percent occurred on a flight crew’s first day working together. Like surgeries and putts, the best flight is one in which everything goes according to routines long understood and optimized by everyone involved, with no surprises.

Unlike Ehrlich and Simon, they were not vested in a single approach. They were able to take from each argument and integrate apparently contradictory worldviews. They agreed that Gorbachev was a real reformer, and that the Soviet Union had lost legitimacy outside of Russia. Some of those integrators actually foresaw that the end of the Soviet Union was close at hand, and that real reforms would be the catalyst. The integrators outperformed their colleagues on pretty much everything, but they especially trounced them on long-term predictions.  ([Location 3124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M6QPRRG&location=3124))\n\n---\nThose who were high in science curiosity bucked that trend. Their foxy hunt for information was like a literal fox’s hunt for prey: roam freely, listen carefully, and consume omnivorously. Just as Tetlock says of the best forecasters, it is not what they think, but how they think. The best forecasters are high in active open-mindedness. They are also extremely curious, and don’t merely consider contrary ideas, they proactively cross disciplines looking for them. “Depth can be inadequate without breadth,”  ([Location 3239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M6QPRRG&location=3239))\n\n---\nBeneath complexity, hedgehogs tend to see simple, deterministic rules of cause and effect framed by their area of expertise, like repeating patterns on a chessboard. Foxes see complexity in what others mistake for simple cause and effect. They understand that most cause-and-effect relationships are probabilistic, not deterministic. There are unknowns, and luck, and even when history apparently repeats, it does not do so precisely. They recognize that they are operating in the very definition of a wicked learning environment, where it can be very hard to learn, from either wins or losses.  ([Location 3260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M6QPRRG&location=3260))\n\n---\nIn wicked domains that lack automatic feedback, experience alone does not improve performance. Effective habits of mind are more important, and they can be developed. In four straight years of forecasting tournaments, Tetlock and Mellers’s research group showed that an hour of basic training in foxy habits improved accuracy. One habit was a lot like the analogical thinking that helped the venture capitalists and movie enthusiasts in chapter 5 make better projections of investment returns and film revenues. Basically, forecasters can improve by generating a list of separate events with deep structural similarities, rather than focusing only on internal details of the specific event in question. Few events are 100 percent novel—uniqueness is a matter of degree, as Tetlock puts it—and creating the list forces a forecaster implicitly to think like a statistician.

If I was in your situation I would probably say, ‘But in a classroom the teacher typically gives us material we’re supposed to have.’ But it’s often the case in group meetings where the person who made the Power-Point slides puts data in front of you, and we often just use the data people put in front of us. I would argue we don’t do a good job of saying, ‘Is this the data that we want to make the decision we need to make?’”  ([Location 3379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M6QPRRG&location=3379))\n\n---\nSo when Geveden became CEO, he wrote a short memo on his expectations for teamwork. “I told them I expect disagreement with my decisions at the time we’re trying to make decisions, and that’s a sign of organizational health,” he told me. “After the decisions are made, we want compliance and support, but we have permission to fight a little bit about those things in a professional way.” He emphasized that there is a difference between the chain of command and the chain of communication, and that the difference represents a healthy cross-pressure. “I warned them, I’m going to communicate with all levels of the organization down to the shop floor, and you can’t feel suspicious or paranoid about that,” he said. “I told them I will not intercept your decisions that belong in your chain of command, but I will give and receive information anywhere in the organization, at any time. I just can’t get enough understanding of the organization from listening to the voices at the top.”  ([Location 3738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M6QPRRG&location=3738))\n\n---\nand only one in twenty made multiple new combinations. The group tracked the impact of research papers over time. They saw that papers with new knowledge combinations were more likely to be published in less prestigious journals, and also much more likely to be ignored upon publication. They got off to a slow start in the world, but after three years, the papers with new knowledge combos surpassed the conventional papers, and began accumulating more citations from other scientists. Fifteen years after publication, studies that made multiple new knowledge combinations were way more likely to be in the top 1 percent of most-cited papers. To recap: work that builds bridges between disparate pieces of knowledge is less likely to be funded, less likely to appear in famous journals, more likely to be ignored upon publication, and then more likely in the long run to be a smash hit in the library of human knowledge.

But inefficiency needs cultivating too. The wisdom of a Polgar-like method of laser-focused, efficient development is limited to narrowly constructed, kind learning environments. “When you push the boundaries, a lot of it is just probing.

It’s more satisfying to have the conversation at a high level and point to finished pieces of software, instead of going down into the weeds and defending the purposes and status of individual outstanding tasks. (We’ll see more in the next chapter about how to report on scopes using the Hill Chart.)\n\nScopes properly drawn are not arbitrary groupings or categories for the sake of tidiness. They reflect the real ground truth of what can be done independently—the underlying interdependencies and relationships in the problem.\n\nBeware the simple question: “Is this possible?” In software, everything is possible but nothing is free. We want to find out if it’s possible within the appetite we’re shaping for. Instead of asking “is it possible to do X?” ask “is X possible in 6-weeks?” That’s a very different question.\n\nThe end of a cycle is the worst time to meet and plan because everybody is too busy finishing projects and making last-minute decisions in order to ship on time.\n\nTherefore, after each six-week cycle, we schedule two weeks for cool-down. This is a period with no scheduled work where we can breathe, meet as needed, and consider what to do next."},{"title":"Being Geek","path":"Resources/Book Notes/Being Geek.md","text_content":"Book: [[Resources/Readwise/Books/Being Geek]]\n\nFinite list of personalities → can be understood with enough experience\n\n### [[Career]] development list of three\n**Technical direction**: Are you actively defining the technical direction for your product?\n**Growth**: Do you understand what you need to do in order to to actively grow?\nLet's see if you're dying:\n-   Have you failed recently?\n-   Is there someone within throwing distance who challenges you daily?\n-   Can you tell me the story of something significant you learned in the last week?\n**Delivery**: Are you hitting your dates?

positional [[memoization]]\n\npositional vs. global memoization\n\tglobal: cache the result of this function (in a hash table)\n\tpositional: cache the result of this function, at this point in the tree\n\t\teg. `remember { Math.random() }`:\n\t\t\tconsistent value across recompositions of the same composable\n\t\t\tbut different value in different parts of the tree (different instances of the same composable)\n\nwhy we need the gap buffer in the first place:\n\tcache composable functions between recompositions\n\tcache key derived from order of nodes (composables)\n\t\tonly possible if tree structure doesn't change\n\tflat buffer: eliminates cache lookup cost, recomposition just reads it sequentially\n\ngroups:\n\tso far positional memoization only works if the cached tree doesn't change between recompositions\n\t\trecomposition reads the cache sequentially\n\tpossible changes:\n\t\tcontrol flow: if, for, while\n\t\tchanging state data\n\tgroups make the linear buffer into a tree structure\n\tassign unique IDs to groups (only unique in the scope, not globally)\n\trecomposition after a change:\n\t\tnew items:\n\t\t\tstop looking ahead in cache, the next cache item has a different group ID\n\t\t\tadd the new item to cache instead\n\t\tremoved items:\n\t\t\tthe same, we detect an item in cache with the same group ID that's not in the tree anymore\n\t\t\tdelete from cache\n\t\tmoving items: bit more complex, but Compose can track this too\n\nUI state:\n\tlocal state that's not part of the domain model\n\tscroll state, text selection, etc.\n\t`remember {}` stores the value in cache\n\tsame positional memoization that is used to cache nodes\n\n[Scoped recomposition in Jetpack Compose - what happens when state changes?](https://dev.to/zachklipp/scoped-recomposition-jetpack-compose-what-happens-when-state-changes-l78)\nRecompose scopes\n\tFor every `@Composable` function that is not returning any value\n\tAnd is not inline\n\tEven for function params that are `@Composable` lambdas\n\tThat is the content lambda of many functions\n\nRecompose scopes are what get invalidated and recomposed\n\tIf a function doesn't have a recompose scope, it won't recompose (maybe its parent will)\n\tA scope keeps track of `State`s that are read inside the scope\n\tOnly recompose if one of the states change\n\n---\n### Compose Compiler metrics\n[Composable metrics](https://chris.banes.dev/composable-metrics/)\n\n---\n\n### Modifier metrics\n```kotlin\nModifier\n  .padding(padding)\n

https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11497)\n\n### Bazel vs. [[Gradle]]\n[Gradle vs Bazel for JVM Projects](https://blog.gradle.org/gradle-vs-bazel-jvm)\nCritique of the above:\n\tBenchmarks aren’t that important, Gradle is not orders of magnitude faster\n\tDidn’t set up Bazel properly most probably\n\tRemote build execution\n\t\tGradle doesn’t support this\n\t\tBazel does, but it’s lot of work to get it right\nBuild config granularity\n\tGradle is easier to maintain\n\tBazel is very explicit and needs lot of toil (or config generation)\nIntegration\n\tGradle integrates into JVM much more, Bazel is an execution engine that delegates to external tools\nBuild correctness\n\tBazel sandboxing has perf problems\n\tGradle’s approach isn’t perfect either, plugins and tasks constantly make mistakes\nDependency management\n\tBazel needs explicit dependency versions → lots of manual work\n\tGradle: version ranges, BOM\n\n### Artifact based [[build systems]]\nVs. task-based\n\n[Artifact-Based Build Systems | Bazel](https://bazel.build/basics/artifact-based-builds)\n> But there are critical differences. The first one appears in step 3: because Bazel knows that each target only produces a Java library, it knows that all it has to do is run the Java compiler rather than an arbitrary user-defined script, so it knows that it’s safe to run these steps in parallel. This can produce an order of magnitude performance improvement over building targets one at a time on a multicore machine, and is only possible because the artifact-based approach leaves the build system in charge of its own execution strategy so that it can make stronger guarantees about parallelism.\n\n> Reframing the build process in terms of artifacts rather than tasks is subtle but powerful. By reducing the flexibility exposed to the programmer, the build system can know more about what is being done at every step of the build. It can use this knowledge to make the build far more efficient by parallelizing build processes and reusing their outputs.\n"},{"title":"Kotlin Flow","path":"Resources/Technical notes/Kotlin Flow.md","text_content":"---\ntags: [public]\n---\n[[Kotlin]] Flows + [[Android]]: \n\t[https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)\n\t[https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/a-safer-way-to-collect-flows-from-android-uis-23080b1f8bda](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/a-safer-way-to-collect-flows-from-android-uis-23080b1f8bda)\n\n### Conflate\nEmission and collection are suspending by default\nCollector might not keep up with the emitter\nSimilar to backpressure in [[RxJava]]\n`.conflate()` operator: ~ `BackpressureStrategy.DROP`\n\nFlows are cold by default\nHot flows: \n\t`shareIn()`, SharedFlow, can keep the flow alive without subscribers, replay count\n\t`stateIn()`, StateFlow, keeps only the last value for replay for new subscribers\n\n### StateFlow, SharedFlow\nSharedFlow: generalized class, StateFlow: special, optimized SharedFlow\nDifferences:\n- `StateFlow.value` to access current item\n\n### SingleLiveEvent alternative\nWhat we need:\n\tReplay: NO\n\tBuffering: YES\n\t\tBuffer until there is an observer that collects the even\n\tInitial value: NO\n\tHáttérben navigálás: rossz ötlet, inkább ne navigáljon\n\tMultiple observers: nem kell (most)\n\n[https://proandroiddev.com/android-singleliveevent-redux-with-kotlin-flow-b755c70bb055](https://proandroiddev.com/android-singleliveevent-redux-with-kotlin-flow-b755c70bb055)\nChannel instead of Flow: guarantee that an event will be processed exactly once\nBuffering: yes\n\n[[Compose]]-specific:\nThere is no recomposition if the screen is in the background\nBut the Flow can still emit items\n\n[https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/a-safer-way-to-collect-flows-from-android-uis-23080b1f8bda](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/a-safer-way-to-collect-flows-from-android-uis-23080b1f8bda)\n\t`Flow.flowWithLifecycle()`\n\tCollection: `collectAsState()`\n\tOr LaunchedEffect for side effects\n\n### Coroutine main-safety\nErre való a `withContext(Dispatchers.IO){}` egy suspend funon belül\n\n> Using `suspend` doesn't tell Kotlin to run a function on a background thread.

Research from Leonard Epstein’s group and others suggests that the answer is yes—by giving the rational brain a little boost using an exercise called ==episodic future thinking==. This phrase is a complex-sounding term for a technique that’s actually quite simple: Before making a decision, you imagine yourself in the future. When making a decision about something that pits your present self versus your future self, such as whether or not to eat a pastry, first imagine positive events in the future, such as your birthday or an upcoming vacation. Place yourself in the scene and imagine yourself enjoying it. The more vivid the imagery, the better. This process fires up the regions in your prefrontal cortex that process abstract concepts like the future and therefore causes your brain to intuitively weight the future more heavily in its decision-making process. This attenuates delay discounting.

setting up code signing in their workflows  \nMy contribution: Implemented various pieces of the code signing refactors in steps like Xcode Archive. I also investigated a performance regression that was surfaced by Reddit's large project, and was able to improve build times by optimizing our code.  \nImpact: Code signing is easier to set up for new users and involves fewer steps in the workflow. This is shown by the data that more people used the updated steps than the old steps a few months after the release. The code signing handling also got 25% faster for Reddit's massive project (all projects benefit from the improvements though).\n\n### Hanging builds\n**What**: Part of the stability initiative, we were investigating what causes hanging builds (that time out after 4 hours, consuming excessive credits) and how to mitigate them automatically.  \n**Why**: To make Bitrise a stable service and gain trust of our customers  \n**My contribution**: I investigated the hanging builds by setting up multiple hypotheses and then testing them one-by-one. I also created a proposal for future improvements to mitigate hanging builds.  \n**Impact**: Although we couldn't find a single root cause that would explain every hanging build, now there is a proposal with multiple improvements to implement, ranked by effort and impact.\n\n### JDK17 benchmark\n**What**: Benchmarking the effect of the latest Java version on Android build speed. Upgrading to the latest Java version is a relatively easy task for mobile teams and can speed up Android builds both locally and on Bitrise.  \n**Why**: Seemed like a low-hanging fruit to help our customers get faster.  \n**My contribution:**  \nResearched the various Java versions and garbage collection configs and set up a benchmark plan with the most promising combinations and sample apps  \nRan the benchmarks and analyzed the findings  \nCoordinated preinstalling the new Java version to all stacks with the infra team  \nWrote a public blog post about the findings and instructions for customers: [![](https://assets-global.website-files.com/60447dd358d1b0e70d47e77b/604630697d25be921d833ffb_bitrise-fav.png)Switch to JDK 17 + Parallel GC and speed up your Android builds by 9-20% - Bitrise](https://blog.bitrise.io/post/switch-to-jdk-17-parallel-gc-and-speed-up-your-android-builds-by-9-20)  \n**Impact:**  \n9-20% build speed improvements  \nExplicit feedback from HelloFresh that it made their builds faster\n\n### Linux VM benchmarking\n**What**: Benchmarking GCP Linux VM configs, finding new configurations that are better for Android builds in terms of cost and performance.  \n**Why**: To get more Android teams choose Bitrise and offer better performance and cost for existing customers  \n**My contribution**: Set up a few representative Android bechmark workflows, measured the build time in various VM configurations, then analyzed the findings and offered optimizations to the current Bitrise stacks. [Benchmark results](https://bitrise.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/STEP/pages/2339700895)  \n**Impact**: We have evidence that the current Linux stacks can be 40% faster for only a 7.5% increase in cost.\n\n### Technical docs\n**What**: Creating detailed documentation of our owned tools and codebases for the new US joiners  \n**Why**: To make onboarding seamless for the new joiners despite the timezone difference  \n**My contribution**: Created detailed guides and docs for a significant portion of our overall docs, such as step development guidelines, step debugging and Go library guidelines.  \n**Impact**: New teammates can seamlessly onboard to our tech stack and codebases async. We also have written answers to most of the common questions that we can link to anyone.\n\n### Default workflow improvements\n**What**: Refresh the platform-specific workflows that the Bitrise scanner generates for new projects. The goal was to improve the chances of a first green build and to improve build times.  \n**Why**: The default workflows got outdated over time as technologies changed. The time it takes to get the first green build is also too high for new projects.  \n**My contribution:**  \nSimplified the default Flutter workflow  \nImproved the Flutter Build step along the way to skip an unnecessary build phase  \nImplemented detection of common build tools in the project scanner that we don’t support currently (such as Bazel, Buck, Tuist). The results are sent to an analytics service for later analysis.  \n**Impact**:\n-   30-40% fewer builds till the first green build across all platforms\n-   We have data about the popularity of not-yet-supported build tools and frameworks in new projects"},{"title":"Bitrise cache behavior","path":"Bitrise/Archive/Bitrise cache behavior.md","text_content":"### TODO\n- [ ] Steps control the cached paths\n- [ ] Branch based archives?\n- [ ] cache service?\n\n## TL;DR Problems\n**Problem #1: It’s not possible to create multiple smaller cache archives and use them selectively in workflows.**\n**Problem #2: Leftover files will never be removed from the cache archive.**\n**Problem #3: In reality, the main cache archive never gets deleted because the main branch is never inactive for 7 days.**\n\n### Basics\n**Caching and build speed:** builds get faster if build outputs can be cached and reused in the next build (avoiding building it again form scratch)\n**Cache archive:** a compressed archive of files and folders\n**Cache archive size:** it takes time to compress, upload and download a cache archive. The bigger the archive, the longer it takes to do these operations, making the overall build slower (sometimes slower than not using cache at all).\n**Cache Pull step:** a step at the beginning of the workflow that 1.) downloads the archive, 2.) extracts the contents to the correct paths\n**Cache Push step:** a step at the end of the workflow that 1.) creates a new archive based on the filesystem state, 2.) uploads the archive, overwriting the previous version\n\n### Single cache archive\nThere is a single cache archive that gets downloaded and uploaded in every build.\nThe Cache Pull step downloads and extracts all the files in this archive. The Cache Push step collects all the files (based on the configurable cache paths) and creates one archive from them, then uploads this archive to the backend.\n**Problem #1: It’s not possible to create multiple smaller cache archives and use them selectively in workflows.**\nIf only 10 files are needed in a workflow, the entire cache archive needs to be downloaded, then uploaded.\n- [ ] Use cases\n\n### Adding and removing files from the cache\nAs developers make changes to a codebase over time, some previously useful files and folders in the cache become useless (this is called cache invalidation) while new files need to be added to the cache.\nAn efficient cache system should handle these situations by:\n1.  removing unused files from the archive, otherwise the cache archive will keep growing indefinitely\n2.  adding new files to the archive so that the next build can reuse them\n\nThe Cache Push step tries to be smart and detects any files added or removed during the workflow:\n```\nChecking for file changes\n5 files need to be removed\n24230 files have changed\n3705 files added\n```\n\nThe step compares the state of the folders after the build to the state of the previous cache (which was pulled).\nThis logic, however, can’t detect leftover files in the cache archive that are no longer useful and should be deleted. The best example of this is when Gradle gets upgraded in a project:\n\nThis is a build before the upgrade:\n```\n1. cache-pull:\n  Archive contents:\n  ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.3-bin [244 MB]\n2. build\n3. cache-push:\n  0 files changed.\n  New archive contents:\n  ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.3-bin [244 MB]\n```\n\nWhen upgrading Gradle, the build will look like this:\n```\n1. cache-pull:\n  Archive contents:\n  ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.3-bin [244 MB]\n2. build:\n  Creates new Gradle wrapper on the filesystem\n  But doesn't delete the old one because it was created by the Cache Pull step\n3. cache-push:\n  1 new file added.\n  New archive contents:\n  ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.3-bin [244 MB]\n  ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.4-bin [244 MB]\n```\n\nAny subsequent build will look like this, downloading the leftover file from the previous run:\n```\n1. cache-pull:\n  Archive contents:\n  ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.3-bin [244 MB]\n  ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.4-bin [244 MB]\n2. build\n3. cache-push:\n  0 files changed.\n  New archive contents:\n  ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.3-bin [244 MB]\n  ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.4-bin [244 MB]\n```\n\n**Problem #2: Leftover files (not explicitly deleted by the build system) will never be removed from the cache archive.**\n\nThis happens because once a file is added to the archive, Cache Pull will always download it, and if the workflow won’t explicitly clean it up (something it didn’t even create in the first place), then the Cache Push step will treat it as an unchanged file, uploading it again.\n\n---\n\nOther CI systems solve this problem by key-based caching. In this system, a cache archive is assigned to a unique key and the archive is created from scratch every time. The key is computed dynamically from variables, such as the branch name and hashes of significant files.\n\nThis means that the cache key changes often after significant code changes, and the cache archive is rebuilt from scratch after these changes.\n\nFor example, if the cache key is defined as android-cache-{hash(gradle.properties)}, then upgrading the Gradle version will result in a new unique cache key. This means that the new key’s cache archive will be created from the scratch instead of adding and removing files from the previous archive. (The old cache archive will get cleaned up because of inactivity)\n\n### Cache invalidation\nCache archives are stored for each [[Git]] branch and are automatically deleted after 7 days of inactivity (meaning no cache pull for the given branch).\n**Problem #3: In reality, the main cache archive never gets deleted because the main branch is never inactive for 7 days.**\nPull request builds “inherit” the main branch’s cache, so those builds suffer from the same problem, not just builds in the main branch.\n\n## Consequences\n1.  Cache archives keep growing over time, making builds slower: Because of problems #2 and #3.\n2.  Caching creates a lot of unnecessary traffic for Bitrise: Because of problem #2\n3.  Caching often won’t make customer’s builds faster: Because of problems #1 and #2"},{"title":"iOS Code Signing notes","path":"Bitrise/Archive/iOS Code Signing notes.md","text_content":"- [ ] Flowchart about different ways of codesigning\n\n# General notes (not Bitrise-specific)\n\n### Concepts\n\n#### Identifier\n\nIdentifies the app (or App Clip) on the Apple Developer portal.

In a nutshell:\n\n-   Gradle knows the current behavior is not perfect\n-   The cache archive keeps growing over time, it’s the same problem across every CI provider\n-   The term for caching Gradle in CI systems is [ephemeral builds](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_resolution.html#sub:ephemeral-ci-cache). The documentation mentions caching the dependencies only, no official guidance for caching build tasks too.\n    \n\nBitrise has two levels of cache: dependencies only and dependencies + task outputs. Caching task outputs makes Gradle skip certain build tasks if its output is found in the cache, but this setting makes the cache archive significantly larger.\n\n### Hints from the official Gradle GitHub Action\n\nThere is now an official Action from Gradle: [https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action)\n\nIt supports caching and it’s enabled by default.\n\nLooking at its source code, there are a few interesting details:\n\n#### Cache paths\n\nThis Action only caches dependencies (from ~/.gradle), it’s not caching build tasks (from the project’s build folders).\n\nThe exact paths to cache: [https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/blob/947a893558d9051f0c24389e50a645015708fcca/action.yml#L62](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/blob/947a893558d9051f0c24389e50a645015708fcca/action.yml#L62)\n\n```\n[\n          [\"generated-gradle-jars\", \"caches/*/generated-gradle-jars/*.jar\"],\n          [\"wrapper-zips\", \"wrapper/dists/*/*/*.zip\"],\n          [\"dependency-jars\", \"caches/modules-*/files-*/**/*.jar\"],\n          [\"instrumented-jars\", \"caches/jars-*/*/\"],\n          [\"kotlin-dsl\", \"caches/*/kotlin-dsl/*/*/\"]\n]\n```\n\nThis config input is marked as experimental though: EXPERIMENTAL - may be changed/removed without notice\n\nOur default cache paths are a bit different. We [include the entire ~/.gradle folder](https://github.com/bitrise-io/go-android/blob/master/cache/cache.go#L118) and exclude some file patterns instead.\n\nI made some tests with the above paths and it reduced the cache archive size in a sample app from ~1000MB (default paths set by the only_deps option) to ~700MB without a build time increase.\n\nFrom the project’s .gradle folder only the configuration cache is added to the cache paths, but this is an incubating feature and not enabled by default.\n\n[A previous version of the Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gradle-build-action?version=v1.5.1) has more details about what this Action is caching exactly:\n\n> This action provides 3 levels of caching to help speed up your GitHub Actions:\n> `distributions` caches any downloaded Gradle zips, including any downloaded [wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) versions, saving time downloading Gradle distributions\n> `dependencies` caches the [dependencies](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_resolution.html#sub:cache_copy), saving time downloading dependencies\n> `configuration` caches the [build configuration](https://docs.gradle.org/nightly/userguide/configuration_cache.html), saving time configuring the build.\n> Only the first one, caching downloaded distributions, is enabled by default. Future versions of this action will enable all caching by default.\n\n#### Concurrency\n\n[[Resources/Entities/Technologies/GitHub Actions]] supports multiple cache archives with different cache keys, and the Gradle Action takes advantage of this by uploading the above cache paths to different archives in parallel.\n\n### Cache invalidation\n\nI think the ever-growing Gradle cache size is a smaller problem in other CI tools because of the cache collection logic:\n-   Every other CI tool: caching is based on cache keys, the key is usually computed from the hash of the Gradle config files. This means that once the key changes, the entire cache archive is discarded with all the unused files in it.\n-   Bitrise: we diff the cache archive file by file and only remove files from it, never delete the entire archive (except for stack changes). If this diff logic is not perfect (and it’s not perfect for Gradle), there will always be leftover files in the cache archive and it will keep growing until the user manually deletes the archive"},{"title":"JDK17 blogpost","path":"Bitrise/Archive/JDK17 blogpost.md","text_content":"\n**Speed up Android build times with simple tweaks to the Java Development Kit and Gradle. After benchmarking build times for 3 projects with different JDK versions, JDK 17 is now also preinstalled on all build stacks to help you get the 9-20% speed improvements we did. Learn more and try them!**\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nGradle and the Android tooling run on Java, and the minimum required JDK (Java Development Kit) version to run these tools is 11 at the moment, and this is the default on Bitrise stacks as well. JDK11 is 3 years old though, and the current LTS (Long Term Support) release is JDK17.\n\nThe inspiration for this experiment was [an article about the performance improvement of recent JDK versions](https://kstefanj.github.io/2021/11/24/gc-progress-8-17.html). We benchmarked the performance of JDK11 and JDK17 on Android builds with the default settings, then with an alternative garbage collector enabled.\n\nBased on the results we decided to preinstall JDK 17 on the build stacks (both Linux and macOS), so you can benefit from the improvements (JDK 11 remains the default though).\n\nThe JDK version used for running Gradle does not affect the final application in any way. The Java runtime on an Android device is independent of the runtime used to build the app on a developer machine. An app built with Gradle running on JDK17 can still run on Android devices with earlier runtimes (because minSdkVersion and compileSdkVersion controls the app’s behavior)\n\n## Requirements\n\nChanging the JDK version and the garbage collector are relatively quick tasks to improve build speeds compared to huge refactors or other long initiatives. There are a few requirements to keep in mind though:\n\n#### JDK17 on Bitrise VMs\n\nWe decided to preinstall JDK 17 on the build stacks (both Linux and macOS), so you don’t have to install it manually and lose time waiting for the process. JDK 11 is still the one activated by default, but you can use [our step](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-set-java-version) to activate JDK 17.\n\n#### Minimum Gradle version: 7.3\n\nThe first Gradle version that [officially supports Java 17 is version 7.3](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html). You might need to upgrade Gradle in your project in the gradle-wrapper.properties file to start using JDK17.\n\n#### Minimum Kotlin version: 1.5.30\n\nEarlier Kotlin versions are incompatible with JDK 17 because of [this bug](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-45689).\n\nBesides these changes, you might have other plugins and tools in the project that need an update for JDK 17.\n\n#### Garbage collectors\n\nThe default garbage collector for both JDK11 and JDK17 is called [G1](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/tutorials/tutorials-1876574.html). There are other garbage collectors that are part of JDK though, and these can be enabled with a command-line flag. The [Parallel](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/parallel.html) garbage collector is available for both JDK versions, and it seems to be ideal for the workload of a compiler (where throughput and memory footprint is more important than latency).\n\nTo change the garbage collector from the default G1 to Parallel, you need to add the -XX:+UseParallelGC flag to the gradle.properties file:\n\n```\norg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4096m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -XX:+UseParallelGC\n```\n\n## The benchmark\n\nWe tested the build time of open-source Android projects running on Bitrise with multiple JDK configs. Build time was measured with the [gradle-profiler](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler) project on Linux EliteXL Bitrise build machines. See the end of this article for more details about the benchmark setup.\n\nOpen-source apps used for benchmarking:\n\n-   [Tivi](https://github.com/chrisbanes/tivi)\n-   [Firefox Android](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix)\n-   [DuckDuckGo Android](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/)\n\n## Results\n\nThe baseline for the comparisons is running Gradle on JDK11 with its default garbage collector, G1. The relative improvements are compared to this config.\n\nFor the Tivi project, we measured a 16% improvement switching to the Parallel garbage collector while still running on JDK11. Switching to JDK17 and the Parallel GC **resulted in a 20% speedup**!\n\nBuilding Firefox on JDK11 with Parallel GC was 5% faster and using Parallel GC on JDK17 is **a 12% improvement compared to the baseline**.\n\nFor the DuckDuckGo project, the percentages are a bit lower, but the pattern is the same as before. Switching to the Parallel GC on JDK11 makes builds 4% faster, switching to JDK17 with Parallel GC **is a 9% improvement**.\n\n### Summary\n\nAcross the three sample apps benchmarked, we see nice build speed improvements with relatively low effort changes:\n\n-   Keep using JDK11, switch to Parallel GC: 4-16%\n-   Upgrade to JDK17, no change to GC: 6-14%\n-   Upgrade to JDK17, switch to Parallel GC: 9-20%\n    \n\n### Benchmark details\n\nFor the benchmark we used a fork of every sample app where we made some changes:\n\n-   Upgraded Gradle to 7.3\n-   Upgraded Android Gradle Plugin as well if needed\n-   Disabled both remote and local Gradle caching if it was enabled in the original project\n    \n\nBuild times were measured with [Gradle Profiler](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler) with the following config:\n\n-   Warm-ups: 1\n-   Iterations: 5\n-   Restarting Gradle daemon between builds\n-   Running the clean task between builds\n    \n\nThe warm-up task downloaded and cached dependencies to ~/.gradle, so the subsequent build measurements were not skewed by network requests.\n\n### Run your own benchmark on Bitrise\n\nWe encourage you to run the same benchmarks to see the exact numbers for your project.

pipelines run on a merge ref for a merge request (refs/merge-requests/<iid>/merge), so the Git reference could be overwritten at an unexpected time.\n\nKipróbáltam, megy: `refs/merge-requests/201/merge`\n\nRefresh a merge ref API call: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_requests.html#merge-to-default-merge-ref-path\n- Returns 200 and the commit SHA if successful →

flag\n\n\n### Our constraints\n- VM disk space\n\t- Also affects image distribution, how many images a host can contain\n- Merged stacks: multiple user-facing stacks share the same base stack, same preinstalled tools\n\t- Stack rebuild affects all merged stacks\n\t- New Xcode appears -> All other stacks get updated too\n- More preinstalled things → more maintenance burden\n\n\n### Customer assumptions\n- The Xcode version they need\n- No surprises\n\t- A thing called stable should not break my builds unless I make a stack change\n\t- Get notified of stack updates before they happen\n\t- A visible roadmap of what comes next\n- Visibility into what is preinstalled\n- Steps to customize the build env at runtime\n- Some generic tools preinstalled\n\n### How to validate the above\n- Survey\n\t- Stack-ranking the criteria (stability vs. having the latest and fastest update available)\n- Open proposal on GitHub, request for comments\n- Look into SWAT metrics\n\n\n### Known issues\n- Android SDK installation is messed up (on Linux, what about macOS?)\n- Default Ruby versions\n- Steps have all sorts of custom logic to select the Cocoapods/Ruby/etc versions\n- Is this bullshit? https://bitrise.io/blog/post/building-android-apps-on-apple-silicon\n\n\n### The basics\n- Policy\n\t- Clarify that even if we try to stick to the policy, there might be unexpected constraints in the future (Apple), but the best we can do is communicate the changes early\n- Update news\n\t- Must be engineer-editable\n\t\t- DevCenter is out of the question\n\t- A separate newsletter that is opt-in and no-bullshit\n- Stack update proposals, period for review\n\t- Even without edge stacks, this is possible with PRs\n- Meaningful stack versioning scheme\n\t- macOS stack flavors: edge/stable/frozen\n\t\t- [ ] Better names\n\t\t\t- The root of the problem is the preinstalled Xcode versions, so we should reflect this in the name (Xcode flavor?)\n\t- Calendar versioning for weekly updates\n- Multiple versions of languages\n\t- Ruby, Node, Python, Java\n\t- Probably asdf above all\n\t- Update policy for each preinstalled tool\n\t\t- Understand how the tool is versioned\n\t\t\t- How a breaking change is released\n\t\t\t- Is there an LTS version?\n\t\t\t- Are security fixes backported?\n\t\t- Understand why it should be preinstalled\n\t\t\t- Instead of defined as a project dependency or vendored in the repo\n\n\n### Beyond the basics\n- Share best practices on the static site\n\t- Docker images, Brewfiles\n- More sophisticated steps for configuring the setup\n- Tool versions as part of `bitrise.yml`\n- Build env API for community?\n\n\n### Resources, guides\n-  [Image build

loops\n\t- Think in quick and dirty prototypes\n- Developer tools are something else\n\t- Core features of Bitrise are not A/B testable (for a good reason), don't even have a UI we could show to customers\n\t- The value of a feature is not evident in a few minutes of usage, it's more like days and weeks\n\t- Hard to demo a prototype of an abstract feature\n\t- Quick iteration and prototyping is also a lot easier on the frontend, but becomes really hard of core, abstract features\n\n### Friday reflection\n#### What's better about working this way\n- \"Every other method would suck
